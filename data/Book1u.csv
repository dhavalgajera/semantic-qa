4,What is you experience around working with co-vendors?,"Gi Group uses sub suppliers for two specific reasons:\n• Quality; in cases where a specific question (profile) requires a specialized supplier.\n• Quantity; When a volume request is so challenging at any given time, it takes multiple suppliers to meet it.\nGi Group works with a trusted selection of sub suppliers for both quality and quantity issues."
5,You must submit a proposal for a Service Level Agreement and the associated KPIs.,"The Service Level Agreement (SLA) is the most important document between Client and Gi Group and describes the cooperation and agreements between both parties. The purpose of an SLA is to make binding agreements about the quality parameters of the service and about the reports. Performance and services provided are continuously measured with Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) defined in the SLA. We believe that we need to measure key figures (KPIs) to manage our organization and to continue to learn. We do this Gi Group broadly, but also specifically for Client. We share the results monthly via an Excel export from our system and discuss them at regular consultation moments.\n\nGi Group proposes the following KPIs to Client:\n• Fulfillment rate (= the number of successful placements vs. number of applications)\n- 99% on forecast\n- 95% other\n• Complaints (= the number of complaints on an annual basis)\n-"

8,How and where do you source the right candidates?,"Our recruiters have the right competences such as; empathy, listening skills and knowledge of the sector. Our recruitment team has all possible tools to reach the right target groups: \n• Extensive possibilities on Linkedin: Premium; Continuous posting of ""jobs""; Linkedin Recruiter;\n• Nationalevacaturebank.nl: CV database search; ‘Topbanen’; many advertisement opportunities; \n• Indeed: budgeted advertisements, CV database search; \n• Advertisement opportunities on topic related websites; \n• Multi-posting on diverse free jobboards; \n• UWV: Contacts with national en regional UWV offices; \n• Social Media: Instagram and Facebook campagnes.\n\nAccurate and continuous management of your own talent pools in our professional CRM system.

This gives us insight into where we should focus more in order to achieve maximum results. \n\nWe regularly perform labor market analyzes and benchmarks so that we are always aware of the local and national labor market. In addition, we are constantly informed about new, innovative recruitment methods. We subject recruited candidates to a thorough competence-based interview, after which we request relevant references. We use these tools to create an extensive profile so that we get a true and fair view of the candidate before he or she comes to you for an interview."
9,How does your company manage different pools? (poolmanagement),"In order to make a planning system work, we will create a pool of candidates based on a medium and long term planning. From this pool we can fulfill new services, accommodate outflow and replace No Shows. If flexibility and the associated planning are not properly arranged, there is a risk that flex workers will not be deployed enough hours to meet their minimal financial need. A too high turnover is the result. We can make an important difference by securing his / her minimum income for the flex worker. The way in which Gi Group designs its flex pools takes these needs into account. As a counterpart to the above wish, when all flex workers from the flex pool are deployed almost all available hours, there is no longer any possibility to absorb unexpected peaks. The scalability is then gone. For example, we compensate for this by having part of the pool consist of part-timers who are less income-dependent, such as students, holiday workers, two-income earners, AOW beneficiaries and possibly subsidy candidates, the so-called layer model."
10,How could you work together with Client to reduce costs for both parties?,"We will work with Client Key Stakeholders to evaluate the existing processes to identify areas cost savings.

Furthemore our Dedicated Account Team – guarantees a significant reduction in administration processes and a streamlined communication. The implementation of service outsourcing processes has a direct impact at reduction of the workload of client HR department."

More than that, we have always at least a meeting/call with the client to calibrate the profile we are looking for, based on the Job Description received from our client. We know Candidate market as well as demographic figures. Direct search is also an important step to ensure that we find the right candidates."
12,"How do you would minimize the risks within temping around sickness, termination, attrition and performance?","Gi Group minimizes risk by firstly ensuring a thorough recruitment, selection and induction process.  Through this workers understand the expectations of them, not just the tasks they will undertake, but their personal conduct.  With regards to sickness levels, Gi Group investigates the reasons for sickness through back to work interviews.  Should issues arise the team will act upon the results and make recommendations for change.  This could be to any part of the process from recruitment to the way the workers clock in and out for their assignment. \nAny performance issues are handled by Gi Group, working in consultation with the hiring manager.  An action plan for improvement will be put into place with timescales for review. Should the worker fail to improve to the standard required then they will be replaced with another worker."
13,Do you have documented issue resolution and communication procedures?,"Gi Group are proud that client satisfaction with our service is consistently high.  Gi Group’s clients and agency workers are well supported throughout their engagement with us. Daily communication with both our agency workers and client hiring managers maximises our ability to manage and monitor operational and temporary worker performance and enables us to identify and correct any inadequacies in supply at a very early stage. Our recruitment processes and procedures are designed to identify candidates most closely aligned to our clients organisational and operational requirements, culture and values, further reducing the risk of assigning disengaged and under-committed candidates. \nIn the event that any performance issues arise with either an element of our delivery function or one of our temporary workers, we would request that the relevant Gi Group Account Manager be contacted immediately.  The Gi Group escalation route would typically follow the structure below. Issues can be raised in person, by telephone or by email.\nDedicated Account Consultant: Should a contract or temporary worker performance issue arise, the first point of contact for complaints escalation would be a relevant Account Consultant.

14,What is from your company's perspective the issues/trends affecting the temporary labour industry during covid and briefly describe you company's response?,"The labour market is currently effected by the Covid-19 pandemic. This has had a real impact on temporary recruitment and agencies have had to adapt to accommodate this situation.  At Gi Group we have risk assessments within each office with PPE for personnel.  Recruitment processes have been adapted to offer remote recruitment, minimizing face to face contact.

16,How do you prevent unwanted turnover (attrition)?,"There are many aspects we focus on, in order to retain our resources. First, it is important to provide the resources a clear planning and a fulltime schedule. They should work as many hours as possible, so the more the better. Second, they must be paid an equal and fair amount. Neverthless, we must ensure the payments are paid on time without a delay. If we keep the workers satisfied, they will not leave our company."

18,Define Client ’s role in the change management (including transition of services and implementation)?,"The starting point is that we assist Client  during the implementation and migration as much as possible and that everything runs smoothly. Client  must be able to continue to focus fully on the core activity, namely production and for the temporary workers, only the logo above the salary slip must change and the rest must remain the same. What we expect from Client , is to terminate the collaboration with the previous party, supply the documentation to the party and initiate a meeting for a smooth transition. Gi Group also provides Client  with a complete package, including all documentation for the releasing party, information sheets, FAQ, presentations for the kick-off meetings and information sessions with temporary workers, but also action and decision lists, etc. are ready to use. Thanks to our extensive experience with implementations and migrations of groups of temps to hundreds of temporary workers, this is in good hands with Gi Group. That is a promise."

However, we work for over a year together with Agile1 on the Merck Sharp & Dome account. Gi Group provides the contracts for perm, temp, freelance and payroll for Merck Sharp & Dome account where Agile1 is the neutral MSP. We also work in other multi-vendor structures with other competitors, based on a fixed market share, where we divided the Master Vendor activities among the preferred suppliers, based on the strenght per supplier. Also, for Client  we can adjust our service to get the best working solution. Whether that will be a vendor preferred structure (what we now see as the best solution for The Netherlands) or any other service model."

We deliver blue-collar employees from the local labor market and cross border solutions. Because of the mix between those recruitment possibilities, we will deliver the best possible service. We always work onsite. Where traditional agencies often operate from branches, our Consultants always work from a customer location and hereby partly fill in for Client . They are an extension of Client  and because of the (part-time) On-site presence, they know exactly what is going on in the operation and with our flex workers. We are physically present onsite for more hours than the standard at temporary employment agencies and are convinced that this is the only right way to achieve maximum retention and performance. In our opinion, the onsite model is the only way to properly implement the HR partnership that Client  aspires to have. The close interdependence between the organizations in the deployment of a large group of flex workers based on temporary employment in a so-called triangular employment relationship, combined with the requirements and wishes with regard to service provision from Client , means that regular but efficient communication is the only key to success. The Corona pandemic has taught the world to adapt to more remote communication through channels like; Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Skype for Business, etc. What has also become clear is that personal physical contact on the work floor is indispensable to strengthen a relationship and to find  creative solutions together."
36,How does your onsite service model works? Also take in considoration the covid pandamic in the answer.,"Where traditional agencies often operate from branches, our Consultants always work from a customer location and hereby partly fill in for Client . They are an extension of Client  and because of the (part-time) On-site presence, they know exactly what is going on in the operation and with our flex workers. We are physically present onsite for more hours than the standard at temporary employment agencies and are convinced that this is the only right way to achieve maximum retention and performance.In our opinion, the onsite model is the only way to properly implement the HR partnership that Client  aspires to have. Gi Group therefore does not have a branch network and is always on-site with its customers, whereby the on-site presence is linked to the hours per week. The close interdependence between the two organizations in the deployment of a large group of flex workers based on temporary employment in a so-called triangular employment relationship, combined with the requirements and wishes with regard to service provision from Client , means that regular but efficient communication is the only key to success. The Corona pandemic has taught the world to adapt to more remote communication through channels like; Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Skype for Business, etc. What has also become clear is that personal physical contact on the work floor is indispensable to strengthen a relationship and to find creative solutions together."
37,Could you explain how the Dutch regulations are around anti-criminal statements for temporary workers?,"In The Netherlands, it is common to provide a VOG. If this is required by Client , Gi Group will request the VOG for the flex worker in the system of Justice. After the request has been made, the flex worker has to log in with his personal user name and password and pay for the VOG. The flex worker can send prove of payment to Gi Group after working full-time for 4 weeks. The payment of the VOG will be paid back to the flex worker. Medical checks are controversial in NL, definetely not common. And Drugs screenings are not allowed in The Netherlands."
38,"Could you describe the operational proces around temporary worker, around sickness due to an accident?","We would let the temporary worker fill in an accident form. Client  will be held responsible because it is responsible for the management and supervision. Gi Group saves the form and contacts the temporary worker. The registration of absence or sickness will go through Acture, our partner where we outsourced sickness management, they are taking over the contact and payment if someone is sick or not able to work anymore. Acture also coordinates the process in case of long-lasting sickness or occupational disability, especailly when there is a ""Arbo"" Doctor involved. After, the temporary worker will receive its sickness payment and enough medical attention to make sure the worker receives the care he or she needs. In case of an EU flex worker, Gi Group can make an appointment with a doctor and make sure the worker receives guidence from the care taker."
39,"Please explain the process of how you will manage transitioned assignments and temporary workers from another supplier.  How do you validate if the temporary worker has earned any vacation time, holiday pay time and other benefits.  How will you ensure the temporary worker is not impacted and does not lose any of the benefits earned with their existing employer by transitioning to our program?","The process of migrating temp workers from another party is described later in the sheet ""implementation plan"". \nThe vacation time, holiday money and other reservations made by the temp at the losing party, have to be paid by the loosing party directly to the temp."
40,"Could you describe the topics cover during an account review with a large, global account pertaining to the services outlined in this RFP?","We describe the following information during an account review; points of evaluation, performance, partnership, plans, forecast, adjustments in contracts, company, all levels of cooperation, hick-ups, other suppliers, evaluation of KPI's, problems that occur, how to prevent future problems, etc."

Also, we plan periodic consultations with the client to discuss what is going well and what needs improvement. We think it is important to search for the exact cause of the problem, in order to solve this problem and thereafter look for possible solutions. We will also measure the KPI's through our system MySolution, which can make realtime reports on a very detailed level."
44,What percentage of your fees are you willing to put at risk to support the Performance Guarantees described above?,"We will determine a ratio and clear definition for every KPI. If we cannot service Client  according to this ratio, we are willing to give a compensation in a penalty/bonus scheme that need to be determined in a later stage."
45,As part of servicing the account can you provide fork lift training and certification? .,"Yes, we work with different suppliers who can provide, among others, fork lift training and certificates. The supplier we mainly work with is BLOM. They have many sites in The Netherlands and can plan on short-term trainings. If a temp worker wants or needs a certificate, we will first make an inventory of the current experience level. After, we will plan the training according to the workers schedule, training can be conducted in week- or weekend days. We will ask the trainee to sign a contract for the costst of the training. If the trainee quits the job, they will have to pay an amount back to us, this amount will lower after more hours worked through Gi Group. Mostly we will train and certify them at BLOM https://www.blomopleidingen.nl/heftruck/"
46,How do you retain resources that have been forklift certified?,"There are many aspects we focus on, in order to retain our resources. First, it is important to provide the resources a clear planning and a fulltime schedule. They should work as many hours as possible, so the more the better. Second, they must be paid an equal and fair amount. Nevertheless, we must ensure the payments are paid on time without a delay. Last but not least; we reall take care of our workers, by walking the extra mile for them. Those are the main reasons for ceritified workers to keep working with us. If we keep the workers satisfied, they will not leave our company."
47,24/7 temporary labor fulfillment and customer service support is critical to ensure continuity of services.  Are you able to provide this service?,"Through our systems, which are all connected with each other, we are able to provide 24/7 support. In this process, Client  and flex workers are connected by the portals that we make available to customers and flex workers. Communication between the portals is supported by Mysolution, our HR software, and coordinated by our planning system. In order to achieve maximum results on replacement issues, our advice is to introduce a reward system in which the flex worker is the stakeholder. We work in shifted shifts with our Flexpool Coordinators between 6 AM and 10 PM 7 days a week and offer 1st line self-support as an IT solution between 10 PM and 6 AM. \n \nThe self-support functionality fulfills the replacement demand, by automatically sending a message to the reserve pool of candidates, allowing the available flex workers to schedule themselves to take over the shift. Thanks to this automated smart tool, any other candidate who has responded as well, will be unsubscribed and the service will be confirmed to the flex worker who responded the fastest. The remuneration system rewards the most flexible flex workers. A lot is possible in terms of reward, but we would like to coordinate this personally with Client . During the week, our Onsite Consultants work normally in between office hours, so from 08:30 AM - 5 PM. but if the customer's schedule makes it smarter to start the day structurally earlier, for example, we sometimes choose shifted shifts.\nOutside the working hours during the week of the on-site operation, other solutions can also be devised to meet the replacement demand. An example of an alternative solution is: Daily up-to-date reserve pool in Mysolution with stand-in workers, which is managed by a senior flex worker or a Client  team leader, who approaches the candidates by phone. An advantage of this can be the personal contact and also the approach of specific candidates first."
48,How will you ensure that Client  is only billed for hours worked?,"We propose the clock system to implement Nedap's PEP Flex. Flex workers clock in and out with their personal PEP Reader. PEP registers the clocked hours of the flex workers. The hours are approved by those responsible and then go to the salary package in Mysolution and Gi Group, that can process the hours for invoicing. The PEP system also keeps track of the contract hours and leave balances. This is always clear to those involved. Clocking in on the PEP Readers is possible upon arrival, but can also be done for example by cost center, line or activity. The readers are equipped with a battery and make contact with one PEP gateway that collects all information and sends it to the PEP software. The collection and forwarding is done via the GPRS network by means of a SIM card that is built into the gateway. This will give you a lot of information about how much and how long work has been carried out to cost center / activity level.\nIn addition, the supervisor has the option to view all hours worked in the current and previous weeks by the employee. The hours and entitlements accrued are also transparent. Both the accrued hours / entitlements and hours worked and allowances are transparent to the employee. It is possible for the manager to make a total overview of the hours worked and to export this. PEP Flex is already linked to Mysolution, so that we can digitally input the hours via an interface. As a result, we reduce the error margins and we can see in real time who is clocked in, which makes attendance checks a lot easier. Running reports is also easy. \n\nThe costs for the implementation and use of PEP Flex are 0,07 euros per worked hour. These are the costs the company invoices to us."
49,What is your incentive/reward program to recruit workers during peak season?,"During peak season, we use extra resources to support the recruitment of the required high amounts of temporary workers:\n\n• We use referral as a recruitment channel. We award our candidates with incentives in the form of value coupons during our tell-a-friend referral recruitment actions;\n• Gi Group can also pay the temporary workers who stay on-board until the end of the peak season, a retention fee of €250, -. Gi Group will pay out this fee to the temporary workers and will charge the Client only a net retention fee;\n• Extra Pull actions and media, based on customized marketing campaigns;\n• Focus on students as this population is willing to work only for a short period of time, fast deployable and flexible so therefore perfect candidates for short peak periods."
50,Describe the training programs you offer your temporary employees?,"Our goal is to strongly increase the quality of the new temporary worker using a thorough selection process, efficient training and a specific integration. As a standard, we provide basic courses for logistics (safety, HACCP, reach truck driver, forklift driver, warehousing, etc.) and develop user-specific trainings on request.  \n\nGi Group reserves 1,02% for training, schooling and education purposes for the benefit of the temporary workers assigned at the Client. Gi Group can use this for all job applicable trainings. If a temporary worker has taken one course, he or she goes back to zero worked hours in this counting system.\n\nExample of a training plan, we developed for another logistic client:\n• LOI English for starters / 350 hours\n• Forklift beginner (2 days) / 600 hours\n• Forklift advanced (1 day) / 400 hours\n• Forklift repeat 200 hours\n• Reach forklift beginner (2 days) / 600 hours\n• Reach forklift advanced (1 day) / 400 hours\n• Reach forklift repeat / 200 hours\n• BHV / 400 hours"
51,Please detail strategy for supplying adapted quality and quantity in highly competitive areas.,"In this scares labour market and competitive economic environment, we will analyse the 'total package' of each job profile with Client. We will compare elements like; salary, recognition, extra allowances, working environment, perspective to enter into a direct employment/contract, company parties, Christmas gifts etc. with the competitors of Client in the area. We also analyse the availability of target groups in the area like; fulltime workers, part-time workers, students, house mothers/fathers, above pension age workers etc.\n\nAfter this phase, we define an unique and most successful package together with Client and use this for employer branding campaign and job advertisement. We deploy specialists if required in order to define the message and communication platforms with you. We also define the best suitable mix of recruitment channels in this specific area of the Client site (online and offline). In co-creation with Client we make a SWOT-analysis, in which the key points relating to; ""Why candidates like to work at Client"" have been processed. We compare the SWOT analysis with a (local) competition analysis, after which we determine together what strengths we use in the labour market communication and which channels are suitable. In doing so, we always keep the costs vs. the expected result in the back of our mind.\n\nFrom our perspective, employer branding can only be realized if the internal organization supports this image and if there is commitment at all levels; before and during the execution."
52,"If Client is not satisfied with one of your temporary employees, what is your policy on replacement?","When a temporary worker, Gi Group, decides to end the assignment, an exit interview will always take place. The results of each exit interview is discussed with the responsible team leader of Client and included in the quarterly evaluation. Extraordinary outcomes are shared with HR.  If Client decides to end the assignment of a temporary worker; Client will specify the reason for this decision to Gi Group. Client must also comply with the statutory termination term ‘aanzegtermijnen’ of the assignment laid down in the Collective Labour Agreement of the ABU.\n\nIn order to avoid early exits (due to illness, if not complying or by leaving on own initiative), we manage our retention policy by organizing evaluations to follow-up on temporary workers and to undertake necessary actions if required. When a contract of a temporary worker terminates, your single point of contact (or onsite consultant) selects a suitable replacement from the outflowing workers, pools or new candidates within short notice. \n\nIn case Client is still not satisfied of one of our employees, a KPI will be defined to ensure replacement within timeframes defined in our SLA. Gi Group makes sure there is a pool in order to enable us to substitute the former temporary worker."
53,Do you provide a general briefing regarding your onboarding proces and the way you prepare the temporary worker before the start of the assignment?,"Gi Group will use or compose information material that is made available for temporary workers that are assigned at Client. The responsibility of keeping this information material up-to-date lies with Client. Gi Group will always provide the latest version of the documents to the temporary workers. Information material and documents have to be approved by Client at all times, before being used operationally.\n\nGi Group is responsible for informing the temporary workers regarding the working environment at Client. Gi Group does this by handing out the brochure ""Working at Client"" and, if available, showing them a company video, in which Client describes all safety, HACCP, house rules etc.. In addition, we discuss and go through each job description separately per person.\n\nThe introduction program is always custom made and the level of unburdening is linked to the number of hours that Gi Group has at a specific site.\n\nSome examples of on-boarding activities are:\n• Tour of the workplace by the onsite consultant ;\n• Provision of safety shoes;\n• Information on company rules and safety rules (signing);\n• Signing of health certificate, if applicable ;\n• Issue of tags and management of locker, if applicable;\n• Issue and/or discussion of an occupational health and safety (ARBO) checklist;\n• Discussing working hours and contacts/superior;\n• Designating how the candidate can be reached;\n• Policy on taking holidays/reservations;\n• Explanation of sickness absenteeism policy;\n• Briefing on health & safety instructions: practical information on the risks associated with the workplace;\n• Introduction of flexworker to Client mentor in accordance with the buddy system, if applicable;\n• Instruction on time recording;\n• Explanation of assessment system and career opportunities at Client;\n• Explanation of other documentation that the flexworker receives."
54,What performance metrics do you believe will help our companies be mutually successful?,"We look at KPIs tool and not as a goal. For each customer we monitor the agreed (and standard) KPIs and create a Service Level Agreement (SLA), in which we add the conditions for the standardization of our services. We report on these KPIs at regular consultation moments. We look at it in two ways; what is the number and what does the number say? Of course it is important to  report, for example, what the attrition rate is, but it is more important to know why it has changed, why it differs from other companies in the sector and region (or not) and what we can do about I together.\n\nExamples of our used performance metrics are: fillrate (%), no-show, staff turnover/retention, response times, forecast to planning, customer satisfaction rate."
55,What KPI's do you track and report?,"We report in the format of a PowerPoint presentation with per KPI:\n1. Result KPI\n2. Reason KPI\n3. Improvement action\n\nA monthly and quarterly structural meeting (evaluation meetings) are the basis for the service continuity as well as a continuous improvement of our services. During this meeting, the results of the SLA’s and KPI’s are discussed."
56,What is the guarantee period regarding permanent placement?,"If the cooperation between client and candidate is terminated during the first month, you will receive a credit note. The following percentage will be returned in the aforementioned weeks after the start date of the candidate:\nWeek 1 t/m 3:                   75%\nWeek 4 en 5:                     50%\nWeek 6 en 7:                     40%\nWeek 8 en 9:                     30%\nWeek 10 t/m 13:              20%"
57,"Regarding permanent placement, which elements are covered in the fixed fee?","The fixed fee in case of a permanent placement includes holiday allowance and other emoluments, such as profit share settlement, tantième and a 13th month. We always calculate the fee over a full-time salary, even if the actual job has part-time hours."
58,What is the distance from your nearest office to our plant/location?,"At this time Gi Group Netherlands has more than 30 (onsite) locations throughout the country and we are continuously groing. Our headoffice is located in Amsterdam in the same building together with our first branch office. We can say we are practically always in close range to our client's location. Thanks to our fully equiped onsite model we can open up a location anywhere in the Netherlands from a volume of 1.000 hours per week, also in very remote locations (we can provide references)."
59,Does Gi Group offer free lance services?,Gi Group is experienced in working with freelancers. Calculation is based on the hourly rate of the freelancer. We apply a standard mark-up of 20% margin on top of the hourly rate of the freelancer.
60,How does Gi Group apply secondment contract forms?,"We apply a secondment rate equal to the gross salary including bonuses and special emoluments multiplied with a factor of 2.4. The minimum duration of a secondment contract is 6 months, based on a full-time employment. We always work with back-to-back contracts."
61,"What possibilities does your organization have, and advise, regarding the training and examination of the candidates, specifically for production and logistics?","Gi Group will use the entire training budget, which is built up by the wage bill Phase A of the temporary workers at Client , to educate and train the temporary workers employed by Client . We look at the needs of Client  and the individual needs of the temporary workers. This includes, among other things, a forklift or reach truck training, and in consultation with Client  (in connection with the use of the location) a high-rise truck certificate.\nLanguage training is also possible. For the White Collar profiles we can offer training through our company TACK / TMI, where training is given in the field of personal development, leadership and changes and innovations.\nTo test; There are a number of requirements that a candidate must meet in order to be eligible for the position in question. The in-house consultant will conduct an interview, on location, with different candidates to find a match for the requested position. For example, if there is a lift, the intermediary will, together with the candidate, like to use a small space at the location where testing can take place.\n\nThere will also be a language test if language knowledge is necessary, this test will be taken in writing and orally. In the case of higher (specialist or management positions), a personality test can also be taken at the request of Client .\nFinally, driving tests for a forklift truck will always be carried out under the supervision of Client ."
62,What is your vision on the cooperation agreement within the bounderies of a maximum 2 suppliers on 100 blue collar temps?,"In the “First Memorandum of Information”, Client  sets the goal of selecting two main suppliers, who use sub-suppliers where necessary (existing parties, if any), in order to be able to comply with a further agreed KPI set. We propose to maintain a 50/50 market share split among the two main providers. In order for this process to run smoothly, uniform agreements must be made with all parties about the services / activities and the performance / KPIs must be monitored via one digital dashboard with real-time data, accessible to both the main supplier, sub-suppliers) as Client  via well-organized web portals. Gi Group has a similar system and if the other main provider does not have this functionality, it can make this service (within the framework of the privacy legislation) available to third parties, under further agreed conditions.\n\nWe recommend that you place the small Plants with one main supplier, cluster them where possible, and distribute the large Plants evenly. This creates intensive cooperation between all parties, whereby we join forces and create a quality advantage for Client . At these large Plants, clear agreements must be made between Client  and the two main suppliers regarding processes, such as; intake, onboarding, planning, on-site staffing, off-boarding, accessibility, systems, consultation structure, etc., whereby a pleasant cooperation and optimal service towards Client  are central.\nFor the large Plants, we recommend using the same market share distribution for the following services:\n1. Unfulfilled services;\n2. Ad hoc services;\n3. Replacement services for unwanted outflows.\nIn concrete terms, this means that we rotate between the two main providers, with regard to the interpretation of a service that has become open as described in variants 1 to 3, regardless of which main provider this service originates from, whereby the main providers are forced in an organic way to ensure let in, retain and deliver sufficient quantity based on the request. We can also facilitate the planning, distribution and tracking of the open services, from our web portals, so that everything is available digitally and in real-time for all involved."
63,How will Gi Group optimize the planning?,"In the area of planning, we see many opportunities in terms of optimisations / cost savings; think of digitization, deployment planning tool, capacity management and uniformity. We recommend, however, to keep the planning process as it is now, and to tackle this project together at a later stage. The impact of the supplier changes, implementation and possible migration already has enough impact on Client , so all focus should be here now. Gi Group works a lot with KPIs within Service Level Agreements, so we propose to determine the KPI types, KPI definitions and KPI levels together with Client . Uniformity and measurability are leading in this."
64,Is an onsite occupation neccesary in your opinion?,"We recommend linking the on-site occupation per plant to two elements:\n1. Hours per week (fluctuating based on peak demand);\n2. Wishes of the Client  Plant in the field of on-site activities.\nThere are Plants, which currently purchase an almost complete on-site service package, and Plants, where it is sufficient to only have telephone contact about the planning and to evaluate once a month or quarter. In our opinion, the on-site occupation is tailor-made for each plant, which we would like to discuss with the various Plants of Client .\n\nOur onsite team, specialists in serving temporary clients in production and logistics, is supported by our central departments, enabling us to work efficiently and to scale up and down if necessary:\n• Central Recuitment Team: sourcing, screening, selection, reference checks, scheduling interviews with on-site team, etc .;\n• Central Administration Team: payroll, questions 1st line flex workers, sick leave, vacation registration, contracting, working hours, invoicing, audits, etc .;\n• Central Planning Team: plans services / transport / accommodation (together with on-site team), n.o.k.d. management, pool management, etc.\nThe on-site team focuses entirely on the flex workers and on the stakeholders on the side of Client . In the case of EU flex workers, in addition to the on-site team and the central departments, we deploy Caretakers, who live with the EU flex workers and make every effort to ensure good living and working conditions for our workers and the quality of the candidates. They are our eyes and ears in the field."
65,How will Gi Group keep track of the attendance of the flex workers?,"We propose to implement Nedap's PEP Flex clock system across all Plants, uniformly for all suppliers. This is the most widely used software package in the temporary employment industry.\nFlex workers clock in and out with their\npersonal PEP only with a PEP Reader.\n\nPEP registers the clocked hours of the flex workers. The hours are approved by those responsible and then go to the salary package in Mysolution and Gi Group that can process the hours for invoicing.\n\nThe PEP system also keeps track of the hours worked with corresponding hour types, such as normal hours, allowance hours, overtime hours, etc.\nThis is clear to those involved in real-time.\n\nClocking in on the PEP Readers is possible upon arrival, but can also be done by cost center, line or activity, for example. The readers are equipped with a battery and make contact with one PEP gateway that collects all information and sends it to the PEP software. The collection and forwarding is done via the GPRS network by means of a SIM card built into the gateway. This will give you a wealth of information about how much and for how long work has been carried out to cost center / activity level.\n\nIn addition, the manager has the option to view all hours worked in the current and previous weeks of the employee. The hours and rights accrued are also transparent. Both the accrued hours / entitlements and hours worked and allowances are transparent to the employee. It is possible for the manager to make a total overview of the hours worked and to export this. PEP Flex is already linked to Mysolution, so that we can digitally input the hours via an interface. This reduces the error margins and allows us to see in real-time who is clocked in, which makes attendance checks a lot easier. Running reports is also child's play.\nThe costs for the implementation and use of PEP Flex are not yet included in our pricing, but are € 0.07 per booked hour, so this is manageable."
66,Could you give a short description of your organization?,"We are a temporary employment agency with national coverage. In the field of temporary employment, we mainly focus on the wholesale market in the sectors Logistics, Production and Customer Care. We supply cross border employees with the sub-brand Move Up.\nWe are part of a global HR service provider that also carries the Grafton (professional organization) and Fashion & Luxury brands in the Netherlands."
67,Name three things that you do differently than other companies?,"1. We believe people are important. Contact with your flex workers and our customers is done by (onsite) consultants who are free from recruitment, marketing and administrative tasks. This allows them to fully focus on what is really important, namely the attention for flex workers and the unburdening of operations and the HR partnership with Client .\n2. We have a healthy mix of personnel from the Netherlands and from other EU countries so that we can always continue to deliver. Because we have both recruitment sources in-house, we can continuously switch and, together with our customers, consider the best solution. Given that we recruit from 8 countries in Europe, it is also not the case that our customers get a dominant second culture in the workplace.\n3. We provide real-time data about our entire services and are the frontrunner in the field of IT and digitization. Whether it concerns management reports, schedules, KPI reports or market analyzes, we offer this information via web portals to our candidates, customers, suppliers and sub-suppliers. In these web portals, we have built clear dashboards that can be adapted to specific customer requirements. As a result, we offer our customers the opportunity to create uniformity and insight into the data across the various Plants / departments, so that together we can make timely real-time adjustments and decisions can be made based on facts."
68,Can you briefly describe how you guarantee the welbeing of your cross-border flex workers?,"Thanks to our own network of recruitment and selection offices in Europe, our screening is of high quality and people are tested on experience and skills by conducting personal interviews in the country of origin. We are a people-oriented organization that pays maximum attention to the candidate with the aim of captivating and binding people. We ensure optimal attendance and flex workers who are flexible in terms of employability, working hours and work size. We offer full service and that means:\n• International recruitment;\n• Travel to the Netherlands;\n• Housing, SNF certified (max. 4 people);\n• Transport;\n• Daily support (personal attention);\n• Supervision of new employees on the 1st day.\n\nEvery cross-border employee is maximally facilitated by us in his or her means to be able to work in the Netherlands and to be successful in the daily work at the customer. Our support of the people is focused on 5 things from which the customer reaps the benefits."
69,Does Gi Group provide housing?,"We are SNF certified and have a registration in the hiring register, where we are inspected annually to see if we adhere to the set standards. We have our regular partners who facilitate us in offering locations where the quality of the offer is central. All accommodation is located within a 30-minute travel time radius to the work location."
70,Do you provide transport?,"Regarding mobility for our people, we work together with a number of partners who provide us with the means of transport that are no older than 3 months and meet all set safety standards. We mainly opt for road transport by car, with a maximum of 4 people allowed in a car."
71,Do you provide health insurance for cross-border temps?,"Every labor migrant receives standard health insurance from us. We arrange this with Hollandzorg. If an employee wishes to opt out of this, this must be indicated to us in writing."
72,"Could you indicate how long the implementation will take, what the costs are and what in your opinion is important for a succesful implementation?","Implementations with the scale of Client  take a maximum of 8 weeks, but practice shows that we often finish most of the work in 4 to 6 weeks.\n\nIn our opinion, a successful implementation / migration consists of 6 elements:\n1. Before we start implementing, invest a lot of time in building a relationship with the operational teams of the Plants of Client , so that we understand each other well and discuss in detail what the plan of action will be. As far as we are concerned, the key lies in the trust from the Plants;\n2. A qualitative implementation team, composed of experienced professionals (at all levels), with a lot of implementation (migration) knowledge and experience;\n3. A Gi Group implementation team that is already involved during the RFQ, so understands the expectations, wishes and requirements of Client ;\n4. Freeing up extra resources during the implementation (migration), so that we always have enough people to complete this process on time and properly;\n5. Thorough preparation, planning, control and implementation;\n6. ""Cooperate"" in advance as a flex worker in the departments, so that the on-site teams understand the operational activities and requirements at Client  well;\n7. A phased implementation, taking into account the peaks of Client , retains a stable flex pool of the current suppliers, roll-out per Plant (eg starting with one Plant and using this as a positive example to other Plants).\n\nWhat we expect from Client  is:\n- Good communication\n- Support and involvement at all levels, in particular with operations on the Plants\n- Insight into stakeholders"
73,What happens after the implementation fase?,"Even after the implementation phase, we will be more than usual on-site on location at fixed times, so that the flex workers can contact us with all their questions and we will handle this for Client . Personal contact is the key to this. During the first few weeks, we regularly check per person whether everything is going well with the salary and whether everything is clear with regard to the candidate portal and candidate file. We also put the implementation and migration, the first two months, on the agenda of the regular consultation moments with Client  as standard. In addition, flex workers can always call our CPA department, which is specially designed to answer first-line questions from flex workers. The back office specialists know the ins and outs when it comes to remuneration, legislation and regulations and the application of the hirer's remuneration at Client , so they quickly remove any ambiguity."
74,What are your expectations from the customer during the implementation and migration fase?,"The starting point is that we relieve Client  as much as possible during the implementation and migration and ensure that everything runs smoothly. Client  must be able to continue to focus fully on the core activity, namely producing the product and for the flex workers, only the logo above the salary slip must change and the rest remain the same and familiar.\nThe expectations in the form of actions can be found in the schedule under point 1. Gi Group also provides Client  with a complete package, including all documentation for the releasing party, information sheets, FAQ, presentations for the kick-off meetings. and information sessions with flex workers, but also action and decision lists, etc. are ready to use. Thanks to our extensive experience with implementations and migrations of groups of tens to hundreds of flex workers, your implementation is in good hands at Gi Group. That's a promise."
75,Which certifications does Gi Group have and with what sector organizations are you affiliated?,"Gi Group has a number of important certificates. Gi Group S.p.A is a corporate member of the World Employment Confederation, the leading staffing union worldwide, see http://www.wecglobal.org. The World Employment Confederation, active in 50 countries, is the voice of the labor market sector on a global level and represents 7 of the largest international organizations active in the delivery of labor market solutions; including Gi Group.\nGi Group Temp B.V is a member of ABU (Algemene Bond Uitzendondernemen). The ABU organization helps employment agencies to add value to society. ABU membership is a hallmark for quality and good employment practices.\nThe establishment of the Association of Detachers Netherlands (VvDN) has been a fact since the beginning of 2019. That same year, Grafton (Gi Group Perm B.V.) joined the organization. Members of the association are organizations or independent labels that consider secondment as their core activity and are active in the Netherlands.\nThe SNA quality mark is the quality mark for the temporary employment sector and work contractors and has been developed to limit the risks of hirers of labor and clients of work. Secondment workers and payroll companies also fall under the scope of the quality mark because they also make work available. https://www.normeringarbeid.nl/\nStichting Normering Flexwonen manages the registers of companies that meet the standard for housing for labor migrants and maintains these standards. Organizations that offer housing for labor migrants can obtain a certificate from the Stichting Normering Flexwonen. To do this, they must meet the standard for housing for labor migrants. https://www.normeringflexwonen.nl/\nThe PayOK Foundation aims to test companies within the chain for compliance with the Wet Aanpak Schijnconstructies (WAS). Because the (main) client is responsible for the remuneration in the entire chain, the assessment by PayOK provides a good insight into the risks that the (main) client runs. By requiring all companies in the chain to be PayOK certified, the risk of incorrect payment claims in the chain is minimized. https://www.pay-ok.nl/"
76,"Do you offer a KPI portal with dashboards, where management reports and real-time data are displayed?","We believe that we must measure key figures (KPIs) in order to manage our organization and to continue to learn. We do this at Gi Group, but also specifically for Client. We share the results monthly via an export from our system, dashboards and we discuss during fixed monthly and quarterly meetings.\n\nWe have all our applications on one platform, namely Mysolution. All data is made accessible in the Salesforce environment, where we use Salesforce Einstein as a data warehouse with Artificial Intelligence functionality. Because we ourselves have the knowledge and expertise to ""build"" on this platform, we can unlock (almost) all the desired real-time data for our customers in simple and clear dashboards.\n\nIn the field of management reports, our customers can see, for example, the hours worked per person per week, average hourly wages, average hourly rate, hour type per Plant or department, but also complex KPI reports, such as; degree of fulfillment, turnover, illness, length of stay and the like. In the area of planning (if Gi Group does this for you) you can see who is scheduled when and to what extent the planning is balanced.\n\nWe have also integrated the applications of Intelligence Group and Jobdigger on this platform. This provides us with a target group dashboard, where we can find all data from various sources and provide us with supply analysis, labor market analysis and target group analysis at a very detailed level. We can even see benefits from Client 's competitors in the same region, looking for the same profiles, as well as push and pull factors associated with these profiles. The possibilities are endless. With these BI tools we can quickly see changes in the labor market, competition and economic changes."
77,"Can you provide cross-border workers as temps? If so, can you indicate which nationalities you can supply?","Yes, Gi Group supplies both target groups, both separately and in the mix. Since Gi Group is active in 58 countries, we can supply almost any nationality. Nationalities with which we have gained good experience in recent years at production companies in the Food and FMCG are; Latvia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Spain. If a company consciously chooses a policy of diversity and inclusion, we recommend that a dominant nationality does not arise in the workplace and in the flex workforce, as a result of which this has too much impact on the corporate culture and atmosphere. This can be easily achieved through the use of smart pool management and monitoring the mix."
78,"What (extra) added value can your organization offer Client , or what is the distinctive character of your organization?","Our temporary employment agency is fully specialized in (onsite) services to companies in the production, logistics and customer care sectors. For this reason, our unique delivery model is scalable, allowing us to easily ""move"" with the extreme peak requirements known within these sectors. This enables us to manage both the on-site team and our centrally organized teams around activities such as; quickly scaling up recruitment (local and in Europe), planning and administration in capacity, enabling us to deliver large volumes of flex workers and guaranteeing quality. In addition, we offer added value to all parties involved in this chain, because we have housed all our applications and data flows on one digital platform in the user-friendly Salesforce environment, which enables us to offer uniformity, insight and control over all processes related to inflow. throughflow and outflow of flexible hiring, by making this data accessible via handy web portals."
79,After how many hours / hours can employees be taken over directly by (an operating company of) Client ?,"Client  is only entitled to enter into a direct employment relationship with a flex worker who is / was made available if he has worked at least 1.040 regular hours for Gi Group. When Client  enters into a direct employment contract with the flex worker, who works as a labor migrant, Gi Group will immediately stop providing extra services such as accommodation, transport, etc. to the flex worker."
80,What do you do to retain and fascinate employees?,"Labor is human work. By giving flex workers the right attention, staff turnover, absenteeism and No Show are reduced and involvement is increased. By drawing up a retention plan, we ensure that the flex workers have a bond with Client  and Gi Group. Four needs are central to the retention plan; work, pay, attention and development. After the right match, the guidance of the flex workers begins. Gi Group guides the flex workers placed at Client  in a human, yet structured way.\nThe flex workers are guided because:\n• Gi Group is the official employer and attaches importance to satisfied flex workers;\n• A satisfied flex worker likes to go to work;\n• A satisfied flex worker performs excellently;\n• A satisfied flex worker is not very absent and stays longer at Client .\n\nWork-oriented guidance for Client \n• Thanks to our many years of experience, we know exactly what the flexworker expects from us as an employer. Based on this knowledge, a coaching process has been developed in which the flex worker is central.\n1. Guidance during the induction process by the Consultant.\n2. Contact moment at the end of the first working day and working week by the Consultant.\n3. Check for need / motivation for training by the Consultant.\n4. Monitoring progress during a training by Consultant.\n5. Contact moment at the end of the trial period by the Consultant with the manager of Client .\n6. End of the first month of probationary interview by Consultant.\n7. Structured evaluation moments (every quarter) by the Consultant.\n8. Compliance with Client  assessment system by Consultant.\n9. Christmas gift and birthday card by the Consultant.\n10. Employee satisfaction survey by the Consultant.\n\nExit call\n• If a flex worker or Gi Group decides to stop working, an exit interview will always take place. The results of an exit interview will be discussed with the relevant manager and included in the quarterly evaluation. Striking matters will also be directly fed back to HR. If a decision is taken by Client  that the flex worker must stop his activities, a reason will be given to Gi Group from Client ."
81,How does your company ensure that customer service candidates is right for Client  and Client  is right for the candidate?,"Our recruiters search for hard criteria to make a long list of suitable candidates. These candidates are approached by telephone or by video calling. Then it is assessed whether they meet the required competencies and soft skills.\nIf that is correct, at least one reference will be checked.\nOnce this step has been completed, the candidate will be interviewed by the onsite consultant who will give a final assessment. The onsite consultant knows the requested profiles well, as well as the corporate culture and atmosphere in the department, so that the candidate is also matched accordingly.\n\nIn addition to our structured processes, we take a language test and calculation test for every possible candidate for CCC, combined with asking a number of open questions related to Client 's matching requirements."
82,What kind of tests and assessment do you apply during selection of white collar temps?,"We have a language test and calculation test that we now use for other contact center customers. After awarding, we will tailor these language tests for Client . We will involve you in this during the implementation process. We can of course share the results of the tests with you if this is beneficial during the selection process."
83,What does your hiring process look like?,"Inflow:\n• Recruitment through online and offline channels\n• Pre-selection / check strict requirements\n• Skype / telephone interview recruiter (possibly pre-assessment, language and math test)\n• Face-to-Face Interview / assessment\n• Terms of employment interview\n• Contract / File / Admin\n• Onboarding\n• Start Flexkracht\n• Guidance / retention\nFlow through:\n• Accompaniment\n• Education\n• Evaluations\n• Transfer options\nOutflow:\n• Exit call\n• Being able to estimate in advance when someone will leave\n• Prevention of outflow"
84,"How will you check the candidate's VOG, immigration status, medical examination etc.?","After application, the original VOG must be submitted within four weeks.\nDuring the intake on site, the Onsite Consultant checks the identification of the potential employee for authenticity and validity by means of at least two security features, namely, the tangible relief and the water shadow mark.\nIf it concerns a residence permit, the potential employee must show the official letter with the BSN number or a health insurance card. If a work permit is required, the potential employee must also show this. This is checked for authenticity by the Consultant. Medical examinations are checked in consultation with the Client within the restrictions of the Dutch law for the relevant points for the Client."
85,What does your process of evaluation of the candidates look like?,"Interim assessment is always in consultation with the customer, as an assessment system has often already been set up. Gi Group's standard procedure is as follows:\n• Evaluation first day (by telephone by Consultant)\n• Evaluation first week (by telephone by Consultant)\n• Evaluation first month (if possible on site by Consultant, if desired with the candidate's manager)\n• Evaluation after six months (on site by Consultant, preferably together with managerial candidate)\n• Annual evaluation (on site by Consultant, preferably together with managerial candidate)\nAll assessments and communication are saved in the Gi Group CRM system."
86,"How is your working method regarding absenteeism, registration and guidance and how do you deal with the contracts with the employees in this case?","Absence must be reported by the employee to the administration department. If desired, this will be passed on to Client  if there is no direct possibility. Absenteeism is registered in the CRM as well as in the back office. This will then be passed on to the UWV. Administration maintains contact with the employee during the illness, in case of long-term illness (longer than 5 working days) or frequent sickness reports (2 times within 2 months or more), this is supplemented by the Consultant. Long-term sick worker who cannot return will be transferred to the UWV."
87,What role do you play with regard to absenteeism management and how do you support Client  in reducing this?,"Attention works, that is Gi Group's vision. Being on site regularly and keeping in touch with the employee ensures more job satisfaction and therefore less absenteeism.\n\nAbsenteeism is mapped by the Bradford factor if desired by Gi Group. When the factor exceeds 100, actions are taken. Those actions consist of:\n• Consultant schedules a meeting with the employee to discuss absenteeism. Of course, taking into account what the Consultant is not allowed to ask by law and without notice of the possible nature of the illness if the employee chooses to tell this.\n• Consultant advises employee to take action.\n• Consultant advises employee to remain in discussion with the team leader about possible areas for improvement in the field of working conditions.\n\nAs soon as the employee is ill, the administrative department remains daily in contact with the employee. The consultant will also contact you if you are absent from work for more than 5 working days.\nIf desired, contact is maintained on a daily basis with the direct supervisors of the employee about when the employee expects to be better again."
88,What services does your organization offer outside of staffing?,"In addition to temporary employment services, whereby in addition to the local recruitment of flex workers (NL-flex), we also have a cross-border organization called Move Up (EU-flex), we offer our customers the following types of services:\n• Recruitment\n• Secondment\n• Detavast (starts as secondment, followed by a takeover)\n• Assisted Recruitment Services\n• Payrolling (in accordance with new guidelines “Balanced Labor Market Act)\n• Freelance mediation\n• Freelance brokering\n• HR Consultancy\n• Assessments\n• Outsourcing"
89,How would you arange optimal poolmanagement and create flexibility for the Client?,"If Client  lets go of certain requirements, the recruitment of candidates will be easier. This extends the flexibility and size of the flex pool.\n\nNaturally, this must be able to fit into Client 's business processes. The current shortage on the labor market requires a solution-oriented approach with regard to the availability of candidates. We are happy to discuss with Client  what is feasible to ensure that continuity and flexibility come together as effectively as possible. We expect that we need knowledge of daily practice to provide appropriate advice.\n\nAn example of creating flexibility is the use of the ""shell model"" below;\n\nThis model usually consists of four layers:\n\n1. permanent Client  employees;\n2. (almost) full-time flex workers; create volume in the workforce;\n3. part-time flex workers; during peak times of the week;\n4. holiday workers / peak workers; flex workers only used for peak periods and holidays."
90,"How can you help with the scheduling, planning and timeregistration?","Forecast:\nIt starts with a forecast, which is made based on numbers and competencies. In addition to the forecast, you have your pool of employees and flex workers. The people in this pool all have certain competencies and contractures. In PEP these competences and contract hours can be assigned per person. In addition to your total pool, you have your available pool. Based on the competencies they have, the forecast and the other available employees, you can determine whether you want to approve the requested leave. By comparing the forecast and the available pool per competence, you know what to act on. This includes training staff, deploying employees from other departments or deploying flex workers.\n\nScheduling:\nThe schedule will primarily be filled in with permanent (flex) employees (strategic). At peaks that are known in advance, greater use can be made of the flexible shell. During unexpected illness or peak times, extra flex workers will be scheduled (operational).\nThe schedule is compiled in PEP as follows:\n• Own employees and flex workers indicate their availability online.\n• Your Gi Group in-house consultant draws up and fills in the roster based on the specified occupation per task and shift.\n• Flex workers and employees can be scheduled based on a number of planning conditions such as availability, position, competences and rostered hours. Based on this, PEP makes suggestions for the most suitable employees. As soon as the timetable is final, the consultant can publish the timetable at the touch of a button.\n• Scheduled employees are informed about the schedule by means of a message and can view their schedule.\nPEP also records the hours of all people who are at work. Whether these are own employees or flex workers. Employees and flex workers clock in and out with their personal PEP only at a PEP Reader. PEP registers the clocked hours of the employees. The hours are approved by those responsible and then go to the salary package and to Gi Group who can process the hours for invoicing. Clocking in on the PEP Readers can be done upon arrival, but can also be done by cost center or activity. The collection and forwarding is done by means of a built-in SIM card. This will give you a wealth of information about how much and how long work has been carried out to cost center / activity level. If an employee or flex worker has clocked in or out, the manager can see who this is in real time in PEP. In addition, the manager has the option of viewing all hours worked in the current and previous weeks of the employee. The hours and entitlements accrued are also transparent.\nPool management\nIn order for a planning system to work, we will create a pool of candidates based on a medium and long term planning. From this pool we can fulfill new services, accommodate outflow and replace No Shows.\nIf flexibility and the associated planning are not properly arranged, there is a risk that flex workers will not be deployed enough hours to meet their minimal financial need. A too high turnover is the result. We can make an important difference by securing his / her minimum income for the flex worker. The way in which Gi Group designs its flex pools takes these needs into account.\nAs a counterpart to the above wish, when all flex workers from the flex pool are deployed almost all available hours, there is no longer any possibility to absorb unexpected peaks. The scalability is then gone. For example, we compensate for this by having part of the pool consist of part-timers who are less income-dependent, such as students, holiday workers, two-income earners, AOW beneficiaries and possibly subsidy candidates, the so-called layer model. We also rotate the person who does not work, so that the result of the fluctuations does not have major consequences for the income of the flexworker.\n\nInformation/reporting:\nBecause you compile the timetable in the same environment and also observe the time registration, a complete flow of information about and for each location is created. Think about:\n• Occupancy rate per location.\n• How is each site performing?\n• What is the ratio of permanent employees versus flex workers?\n• Does my schedule match what actually took place and where are the gaps?\n• Insight per cost center / activity how many hours are worked here.\n• Insight for both manager and employee in the accrued hours and rights.\nYou will find all this in a simple interface.\n\nKnowledge:\nThe data that enters PEP is converted into information. With this information, knowledge is increased and action can be taken to, among other things, achieve a better occupancy rate. Also think of insight into the different activities to determine exactly where the most hours are worked and whether this corresponds with the budgets. The simple and fast insight into the accrued hours of employees also ensures that nobody is faced with surprises anymore."
91,Could your provide business intelligence data from the labor market?,"Gi Group uses the Mysolution software, an all-in-one solution, where the front, mid and back office are fully integrated in one system. This gives Gi Group the opportunity to analyze in detail all data that is released in the process from inflow, through flow to outflow, and make it available to Client . In MySolution, Gi Group has also integrated the Intelligence Group target group dashboard, so that we have all the necessary information regarding supply analysis, labor market analysis and target group analysis. This gives Client  an edge over competing companies in the region that are looking for the same kind of profiles. We can even map the current employment conditions of the companies in the region using public data that is accessible to us.\nExamples are:\n• insight into recruitment feasibility: what percentage of your target group is actively and / or latently looking? How scarce is your talent? How often are these accessed?\n• insight into where and how you can reach your target group: through which media channels can I reach the active and latent target group? Which (pull) factors get him or her moving? What are their hobbies and interests?\n• insight into the (regional) labor market: what is the average salary offered? Who are your competitors? How long are vacancies open on average?\n• the correct target group information to manage realistic expectations towards Client"
92,What is your advice regarding reversed billing?,"Gi Group is familiar with reversed billing from clients. Our software is set up for this. If necessary, for example in the event that Gi Group acts as Master Vendor, we can also apply reversed billing towards sub suppliers. We use the Microsoft Navision software within MySolution for this."
93,What do you expect from Client  in order to achieve optimal cooperation?,"In order to achieve optimal cooperation, we expect Client  to open up (across the breadth of the organization), in order to grow towards a strategic HR partnership together with Gi Group. The basis for optimal cooperation are and will always be the people who shape this cooperation, this is the key to us.\n\nIn our opinion, the following common values are important to achieve optimal cooperation:\n•Communication:\nEverything starts with a committed team and listening carefully to each other. Without listening, no one is able to fully understand the causes of bottlenecks and / or problems, making it impossible to create a solution that delivers results. In our opinion, a communication structure in which we consult frequently and efficiently and remain focused on the content is a basic requirement. Equality in communication is an important starting point and that is how we keep everyone involved.\n\n• Self-reflective ability:\nSelf-reflection means looking at oneself and thinking about one's own actions while holding up a mirror to oneself. The degree of self-reflection partly determines to what extent a team can learn from its own experiences in order to do better in the future. In our opinion, self-reflection is a key to success.\n\n• Ambition:\nBy having a common ambition level, with which we always set the bar higher and want to surprise each other (+1), you create added value. With every project where we exceed the ambition, our relationship will strengthen and a strong sense of pride will arise. ""Cooperation gets way easier if you're doing something you deeply care about and believe in!""\n\n• Creativity:\nBy looking at (existing) problems and / or solutions together in different ways, you create new solutions. Brown paper sessions, design thinking and lean methods are examples of creative ways to arrive at these solutions. Sharing Case Studies and Best Practices from both organizations across countries can also contribute a lot.\n\n• Maneuverability:\nShort lines of communication within an organization are a precondition for being able to switch quickly. In addition, both the organization and the people who work here must be able to deal with a climate of continuous change. Good leadership is crucial to keep a large organization agile. Client  and Gi Group together form one committed team, so agility is something that we guarantee."
94,Do you have an escalation proces in place?,"We create an escalation matrix so that every escalation enters the correct level in both organizations and if it is not resolved within the specified time, it is raised one level from the first operational level to the level of management."
95,"What is your cancellation policy for temp assignements (""aanzegtermijnen)?","The client can only cancel a temporary worker within a reasonable time prior to the start of the assignment without payment. Of course, we would like to have an accurate forecast, because we assign resources of our recruitment department to the client.  When a temporary worker has started working, the actual worked hours have to be paid to the worker. This is the Dutch legislation. When a temporary worker attends at the site and it turns out, that there is no work available and the temporary workers is send home, the client has to pay 3 hours.\nWhen a temporary worker is assigned in a phase A agreement, the client can terminate the contract any time during the 78 weeks that phase A is applied. In the case of an agency work employment contract with agency clause, the private employment agency shall notify the temporary worker in good time about the approaching expiry of the temporary work employment contract, so that the temporary  worker can make preparations, taking into account the following period of notice:\nCHECK WITH NEW LEGISLATION: Duration of placement in worked weeks Period of notice in calendar days.\n• 0 to 12 weeks 0\n• 12 to 26 weeks 5\n• 26 to 52 weeks 10\n• 52 up to and including 78 weeks 14"
96,What is your procedure for auditing and approving the hours worked?,"Administrative organization is the basis of our service to the client. After all, a simple, error-free, accurate administrative process yields efficiency, timesaving’s and insight. Our main administrative processes are; time registration, hour processing, remuneration, contracting, invoicing and reporting.\nWe have decided to mostly centralize, automate and digitize our administrative processes in one platform Mysolution. In order to guarantee the quality and continuity of the administration our Central Admin Team (CAT) takes care of the administration for our temporary employees and clients working from our head office. The Consultants are thereby relieved and can occupy themselves with what really matters; our temporary workers and our clients.\n\nOur back office system is also integrated in Mysolution. Mysolution is specially made for staffing agencies, secondment agencies and payrollers, so that the ABU Collective Labour Agreement, hirer's remuneration (‘inlenersbeloning), the ‘Arbeidstijdenwet’ and other Dutch laws and regulations are applied optimally. Nocore provides our customers and temporary workers with smart Portals and useful Apps. \nBesides our Consultants, the Central Administration Team also works in Mysolution. This team processes all hours of temporary workers, including changes, holiday requests etc. The Central Administration Team also generates and manages all the contracts and dossiers for temporary workers.\nWhen it comes to hour tracking and time registration for the client we offer three options:\n- Web Portal: Temporary workers register their worked hours via our Web Portal, after which the manager of the the client approves the hours. Gi Group does a final check, after which the hours are exported into our back office system.\n- Excel file: Our back office system is able to digitally receive and read an Excel dump (in a fixed format) made by the client or generated by a time registration tool. This process is completely automated, so takes less time for both Gi Group and the client.\n- PEP-reader: For logistics and production environments, we use Nedap's PEP reader, a time registration system. When using the PEP reader, the temporary worker clocks in on arrival, at the end of the working day he clocks out again. The hours are thus real time in the the client's system. After approval, Gi Group does a final check, after which the hours are exported to our back office system."
97,"Define the transition and migration plan (SMART). Mention the critical factors, possible risks and risk-mitigation steps per site. Besides that, describe which information you need from the Client in order to execute the transition and migration plan. Define which migration period (duration) would be feasible for you.","At Gi Group, we have an international standard as it comes to implementing. In each country, we have a similar way of handling this process, adjusted to the local needs. This process consists out of nine mayor steps, which we can conclude in 40 days or less. Our implementation plan goes in more detail and the mayor steps, slightly different grouped, fall in minor steps. Lesson’s learned concerning transition and migration:\n• 99% of the temporary workers goes along with the transition to a new supplier;\n• After the takeover term (1.040 hours is industry standard) temps can always be migrated free of charge from incumbent suppliers;\n• Partnership, communication, lean/clear process and project management are key for success;\n• Gi Group coordinates and unburdens the client optimally during the entire transition and migration process;\n• We guarantee the client a smooth migration, so that client's organisation and its customers do not notice it;\n• Reservations of the temporary workers, like holidays and holiday money, are paid out when they are migrated. This is the Dutch law.\n• Preparing a 'buffer' of temporary workers prior to the migration is smart (often proves to be unnecessary).\nWe have developed the implementation and migration process systematically and always work with a detailed action plan and planning. With this, we guarantee a flawless and smooth execution together with the client. Gi Group has a lot of experience with implementations and migrations. If desired, we have clients within the same sector, with similar profiles and a comparable number of hours, who want to act as a referent towards the client.\nBefore we start the implementation phase, sales will gather all needed information in an inventory document. This covers the information for our departments; finance, administration, recruitment and operations. Operations takes the lead when the implementation phase starts and will complete or adjust this inventory file during the implementation process. \nWe attached another important document, namely the migration document that needs to be filled-out by the incumbent suppliers."
98,How can Gi Group support the client with cost savings?,"The biggest direct cost saving by far is generated by the migration of the temporary workers, from the incumbent supplier(s), towards Gi Group against a strong reduced migration multiplier for all profiles. The magnitude of this cost saving is easy to calculate by the client. \nIf the client is doing the planning and pool management itself, we estimate the saving we can generate from planning and pool management is somewhere between 5% – 10% of the total spend of hours within this part.\nWhen it comes to cost saving, Gi Group works from the principle of Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). We developed a model for TCO that enables us to analyse our client’s core processes and filter and reduce or eliminate bottlenecks.  \nWe also perform a Fresh Eyes Review every 18 months, to stay sharp and proactive in the cooperation with the client. Because the actual DNA of Gi Group was created after the takeover of Worknet, the onsite internal staffing agency of FIAT CHRYSLER AUTOMOBILES, our culture is lean from the start.\nExperience with manufacturing companies teaches us that we can divide cost savings in two groups: \n1. Core processes: 90% of cost savings can be realized in direct costs for example reduce number of hours and supplementary hours by planning and pool management, onetime cost saving through migration of the current flex workers against a payroll multiplier and reduce absence and now show rates by introducing loyalty incentives and training programmes for temporary workers.\n2. Non-Core processes: about 10% of cost savings can be realized in indirect costs. The Master Vendor model is well equipped to generate cost savings in these non-core processes. \nFrom our work ethics and DNA we find it important to:\n• Work from the principle of the DMAIC cycle from (Lean) Six Sigma;\n• Involve Gi Group colleagues from other countries, to actively share their knowledge and experience;\n• Involve the client’s employees from other locations / countries, to actively share their knowledge and experience.\nFor the cost saving in the field of non-core processes, mentioned in group 2, we propose to implement a Master Vendor model. Implementing a master vendor generates savings in the fields of:\n• Contract Management (co-vendors)\n• Workforce Management (temporary workers)\n• Planning en pool management\n• Hour tracking (one flow)\n• Invoicing (one flow)"
99,Could you describe the proces of pre-selection during recruitment?,"Pre-selection of candidates is centraly organised and is being performed by our Central Recruitment Team. This means our Onsite Consultant only receives CV's of candidates which already match the hard- and soft factors the client demands. This contributes to operational efficiency. Previous to the pre-selection Gi Group and the client determine the generic and specific requirements regarding the selection. The hard facts (salary, certification, distance, language, transportation, flexibility, availability, experience) are discussed between the recruiter and the candidate. Apart from that we look for candidates matchin with the client's culture and values. Through this procedure we guarantee a 100% match on hard and soft facts , through which the candidate quickly finds his/her way regarding tasks, procedures and culture and will therefor quickly be productive. Through interviews we gather information on behaviour, knowlegde and certain competences which need to be developed. If required we can complement the selection process with an assessment or skilltest."
100,What does your service model look like?,"We designed our temping service model around our logistic clients and made it very efficient and scalable, because we centralized all tasks that allow themselves to be centralized, by running the departments:\n• Central Recruitment Team: sourcing, screening, selecting, reference checks, plan the interviews for the On-Site team;\n• Central Admin Team: salary payment, 1st line for questions, sickness, leave, contracting, hour processing, audits;\n• Central Planning Team: planning (closely with the On-Site team), no show replacement.\nOur On-Site team consists of On-Site Managers (we call them Onsite Consultants), that are fully focused on Workforce Management and Account management, because the other tasks are being done by the centralized divisions. Besides this, we work with Shift Supervisors (we call them Caretakers), that manage most of the operational tasks during shifts on the work floor."
101,What are your unique capabilities?,o Data driven organization;\no Balanced workforce mix between locals and people from a wide range of other countries;\no Partnership for full HR cycle.
102,What is your team structure and could you give a brief desription of each teammember?,"Solution Manager\nInvolvement starts in the RFP phase, when designing the solution and will work closely with the implementation manager and On-Site team during start-up phase. Will be involved during the contract when we face changes and growth.\nImplementation Manager\nWill have a leading role, during implementation phase, working closely with the Solution Manager. Knows the processes, systems and Dutch legislation by head. Works within strict and uniform processes, that have been fine-tuned to operational excellence, by the high number of implementation done over the years.\nAccount Director\nOversees the partnership from a tactical and strategical perspective. Is a member of the Dutch board, so has very short lines within the organization. Is present at quarterly and yearly evaluations.\nOperations Manager\nIs managing the On-Site team and partially the centralized divisions. The Operations Manager will be present at the quarterly and yearly reviews, to review and improve the partnership between Gi Group and Client. The Operations Manager also acts as level 2 escalation point.\nCentral Recruitment Team\nThis team support the On-Site team with recruitment activities, like; job posting, recruitment marketing campaigns, sourcing, screening, selecting, reference checks and planning of the final interviews with the On-Site Manager. The team also takes care of the Client talent pools.\nCentral Admin Team\nThis team supports the On-Site team regarding back-office, like; salary payment, hour processing, sickness & leave management, etc. and is also the 1st line of contact for temps regarding administrative questions.\nCentral Planning Team\nThis team support the On-site team with the planning, pool management and the replacement of no shows. For our cross-border temps, they also take care of the planning of housing and transport.\nFinance Team\nI responsible for the invoicing process, debt management and controlling activities for Client.\nOn-Site Team\nThe On-Site team; On-Site Manager (1 FTE), Shift Supervisors (3 FTE) and On-Site Support (1 FTE)  are covering all the tasks as described by Client in the document “NL_Onsite_Management”. The team as a whole, will also cover the 24/7 reachability demand that comes with the 5-shift rotation model, that will be applicable in The Netherlands. If the volume of Client exceeds 50 FTE, we can consider an extra On-Site Manager, but in our service model, where the On-Site team is supported by centralized departments, we often can reach 75 FTE with 1 On-Site Manager."
103,Could you descripe you recruitment and sourcing strategy?,"Our sourcing strategy is based on a smart mix of channels & tools for reaching out to relevant active and inactive candidates on the market. The aim is to reach out, select and keep the best candidates available in the area of the Client. Gi Group has a Central Recruitment Team (CRT). This is a centralized and specialized recruitment team based in our HQ in Amsterdam. Thanks to the CRT, we are able to scale up and down very quickly for our customers, because we can schedule recruiters in a timeframe of 3 hours for our customers in The Netherlands. The CRT is responsible for recruitment, pre-selection, reference checks, talent poolmanagement and the arrangement of face-to-face conversations for our On-Site tea,. The CRT makes use of the latest IT applications and, in addition to the traditional telephone line, also makes extensive use of WhatsApp (messages / video), text message, Facebook and FaceTime."
104,How do you attract candidates?,"• Nurturing databases of active and latent seeking candidates and employees for return.\n• Gi Group can also use references as a recruitment channel. We motivate our candidates with incentives in the form of value coupons during our tell-a-friend referral recruitment actions.\n• Gi Group can also pay the temps who stay on-board until the end of the peak season a retention fee.\n• Display advertising.\n• Banners on websites with specified target group affinity, corresponding with geographical data .\n• Action-driven landing pages that focus on the traffic and provide application points to the candidates:\no First mobile design of these landing pages.\no Fast application process & flexible application form."
105,Could you give us some examples of offline recruitment channels you use?,"• The back of the bus and/or bus stop posters.\n• Hand-out leaflets, posters at schools, universities, student hotels and industrial areas.\n• Advertising in local papers, magazines and local sponsoring, etc."
106,How do you attract and recruit good candidates? What software and data sources do you use?,"In a rapidly changing market, it is necessary to keep renewing and innovating. Smartphones, Big Data, Smart Analytics, Social Media, Communities, Machine Learning and Apps have become part of our lives. For recruitment, Gi Group uses the most innovative online channels, trusted and effective offline channels and other modern tools. We use the Applicant Tracking Software to increase the productivity of our Recruiters, and to manage the entire recruitment funnel and registration process. Nevertheless, we make use of the Intelligence Group software, which enables us to have an insight on the market and a complete analysis of it. Also, Gi Group has a lot of experience in the area the region and knows it by heart. By AB-testing and analyzing all our data, we have developed a strong understanding of which campaigns and recruitment channels are the most successful per target group, geographical area and profile. Our current strategy is that we constantly hunt for the best candidates, instead of a passive approach where you wait for applications on the job advertisements and only use the existing database."
107,How do you use attificial intelligence (AI) to analyse data and apply machine learning in you recruitment proces?,"We use Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning for the pre-screening of candidates that apply to one of our open vacancies. When a candidate applies to one of our job profiles or registers itself on our website, AI will pre-screen the candidate that results into a ranking. The candidates with the highest ranking appear on top of the dashboard of the recruitment team, so the recruiters can make choices that are based on the work that has already been done by AI. The ranking of the AI is based on the following criteria:\n• Candidate profile;\n• Vacancy profile;\n• Comparison with other candidates in the database;\n• Account profile.\nWhile AI assess and compares all these criteria’s, the outcome is a ranking within a scale. The more candidates go through our system, the smarter the AI gets by machine learning. The advantage for Client is, we increase the quality of our process and candidates on a standardized way, for the entire recruitment team."
108,What IT landscape do you use to provide you services and gather and analyse data? Do you have dashboards for the Client and candidates?,"Gi Group uses Mysolution, the best all-in-one HR solution for agencies available on the Dutch market, where front-, mid- and back office data are integrated in one system on the Salesforce platform. All our functionalities are integrated in the same environment, so we support a full life-cycle of the data and connect all the dots. Instead of only using the standard Mysolution functionalities, we added a big number of supporting applications like; Salesforce Einstein, OnRecruit, Company.info, Jobdigger, Intelligence Group, Avnio, InGoedeBanen, etc. Another valuable application of Mysolution, is that we can build a custom made portal for Client, where we can share all relevant real-time data in the Salesforce environment like a real-time planning overview, management reports, KPI dashboards and vacancy tracking, but also more basic data like; average hourly rate, average multiplier, the amount of hours per type per week per department, etc."
109,Could you mention one innovation on the recruitment side of your company?,"We have integrated the NIXZ recruitment robot in our process, to automate easy repetitive tasks. Once we have learned NIXZ what to do, the robot takes over basic tasks from our recruitment department. When we give the NIXZ robot a vacancy, it checks the Indeed database for suited candidates, checks of the candidates are already in our system, if yes; it checks if the candidates do not already have an assignment, if yes; it sends out an automatized message by WhatsApp/email if the candidate wants to work for your group, if no; it asks a recruiter to send a message from the Indeed platform. The advantage for Client, is that we are able to scale up over 35% more rapidly because the robot takes over repetitive tasks."
110,What planning tool / software could you provide to the Client?,"Gi Group Netherlands has its own planning software, that we can offer free of charge to Client. It offers a wide variety of functionalities. Besides people, we also plan our cars park and housing locations we use for our cross-border candidates.

Our location is less than 20 kilometres form the Location. Besides our headquarters, we have over 30 SMS (Site Managed Service). Gi Group.\nWith our model Gi Group provides, in addition to traditional staffing services, more personalised projects like the SMS (Site Managed Services, in which we carry out activities and constantly monitor operations directly at the customer's site) and Permanent Professional Recruitment (Search & Selection).\nFrom our headquarters in Amsterdam we have centralized the recruitment, planning and back-office."
116,Could you give a general discription of Gi Group Holding International?,"Over the years, the Group has changed from being a local temporary labor provider to a global provider, with a diversified range of HR solutions and geographical markets. \n\nHaving invested in the past years to consolidate its presence worldwide, Gi Group is now ready to benefit from sales growth that will lead to margin increase in the countries where Gi Group has a longstanding presence.\nThe route to achieving Group’s purposes requires significant expansion investment, which started in the previous decade, to implement the Group’s commercial strategy, which sets out:\n• the Group’s presence in new markets, through acquisitions or opening start-ups directly;\n• expanded geographic coverage, by opening new branches;\n• supported growth, in terms of volumes and market share;\n• consolidated Group presence in some markets, also through acquisitions (to increase market share or to start new business lines);\n• increased value proposition for customers, by starting new business lines thanks to synergies generated by an already existing organization;\n• business models, processes, systems, in general, all the infrastructure necessary to organize the Group’s activities under one global image, “One Company”.\nThe activities, economics and strategies connected to some relevant Countries are described in the following paragraphs aimed at showing the Group’s trend of the last two Years (figures FY 2020 are provisional).\nGi Group Netherlands is the employment agency in Netherlands, operating since 2015 and it had a trend of growth in commercial Temporary and Permanent Search and Selection activities.\n\nThe focus on large corporate customers has led to satisfying results, particularly in terms of volumes in the logistics division. Activities have been diversified and Gi Group has started to provide assistance to Contact Centre customers on a large scale.\n\nIn 2019, new business services were offered under the Grafton brand, with particular emphasis on the Finance & Accounting, Logistic & Supply Chain, Office & HR, Sales & Marketing and IT sectors, and new Search and Selection businesses were approached. In 2020 we onboarded mainly new customers. Working in the new world effected by Covid we adopted our methods and structure slightly, but the already strategy of centralisation and digitalization were a good base to start on. Despite Covid we doubled our activities in The Netherlands during 2020. We also strengthen our national footprint and innovated our HR solutions, as well in regard to the new legislation (WAB) that is applicable from January, 1st 2020, as from an IT client value perspective.\n\nDuring the financial year, the existing Gi Group company changed its name to Gi Group Temp, to dedicate itself completely to Temporary Staffing, and the Group has established 2 new companies dedicated to Permanent Staffing and Freelancing businesses. The three companies have been brought together under Gi Group Holding B.V., the newly-formed Dutch holding company. \n\nVarious objectives were fixed:\n• to develop the Temporary Staffing business,\n• to generate profitability via Specialist Recruitment activities under the Grafton brand and in the Fashion & Luxury sector,\n• to begin an international mobility program in support of Temporary Staffing activities,\n\nIn 2019 Gi Group Netherlands revenues totalled +93,7% compared to FY 2018 and an increase also in figures 2020: +97,7% towards FY 2019. \n\nGi Group has a global vision of the development of the market:\n• We aim to act as an innovative response to Corporate companies (multinationals with a large presence on a global scale),\n• Gi Group's focus is on the need to combine service and competitiveness with solutions able to intercept the needs of the market - in this phase of the increasingly candidate-driven world economy - through strategies in concert with the client, that take into consideration the demands coming from the increasingly magmatic labor market.\n\nIn 2019 Group revenues totalled +13.1% compared to FY 2018 and it is forecasted for 2020 the same volumes of revenues of the previous year even if we had to manage the pandemic at ww level. \n\nThis projection confirms the positive evolution for the Group in terms of organic growth in Italy and abroad.\nThe increase in economics involves not only volumes but also profitability: Gross Profit growth is driven by top-line increase and slight improvement of margins.\nWe report below the table with Group worldwide highlights.\n\nEBITDA at global level in 2020 was +59,4 mln€.\nThousand Eur  2019 2020\nRevenues 2.567.554 2.522.753\nGross profit 330.634 308.062\nGP % on REV 12,88% 12,21%\n\nThe soundness of the financial structure of the Group is another important measure of evaluation: despite the investment policy, the Group applies a prudent financial management strategy, granting an adequate level of cash & cash equivalents and the availability of sources of borrowings via an adequate quantity of credit lines and through the factoring usage. The Group increased the ratio between medium and long-term investments and the total debt, supporting investment and business development plans. Financial interlocutors are mainly chosen if they have a high credit standing and by limiting the concentration of exposure to such institutions. \nIn the coming years, the Group intends to pursue this growth strategy: a commercial product line which is ever more aimed at the verticalisation and diversification of solutions, assessing acquisitions in strategic countries, with the objective of widening our global presence."

124,Can you describe your culture?,"Our organization and the people who work for us are extremely versatile. We can adapt quickly and easily when changes occur. An example is our response to the outbreak of the pandemic, in which we switched quickly and immediately adjusted our processes. We have also responded proactively to the introduction of the new legislation “Balanced Labor Market Act” by aligning our processes, legal structure and contract forms with this.\nIn addition to the short lines within the organization, everyone in the company is accessible, colleagues are always open to feedback and they are available to help each other. Mutually we bring out the best in people through internal training, by constantly motivating each other, by a critical attitude towards each other and towards ourselves and by applying self-reflection. Everyone is given the space to take their own responsibility, instead of constantly checking whether someone is on the right track. Another important aspect of our corporate culture is that we offer growth opportunities to our employees. We like to give our employees the space to continue to develop themselves at a professional level and stimulate people to climb up within the company or to broaden within a field. Our employees are constantly looking for areas for improvement and for smarter ways to optimize our services. We also find it important that everyone is aware of everything that is happening within the company and that everyone is treated equally, regardless of position or role. In addition, between work there is always room for socializing and for conversations about topics outside of work, which creates a strong team and interpersonal relationships."
125,"How does Gi Group organises training, development and employee satisfaction?","eNPS:\nThe eNPS (Employee Net Promoter Score) is a way to measure employee engagement with the company and find out which aspects you can improve. Our NPS score in 2020 was 39.3. Most companies consider an NPS of 0 to be respectable. A positive NPS is considered good and an NPS of +50 is considered excellent.\n\nWe score best on the following topics:\n• Organizational wellbeing\n• Innovation\n• Trust (in management and colleagues)\n• InvolvementThe HR structure\nHR cycle:\nThe Gi Group HR Cycle consists of a goal setting meeting, a progress meeting and an assessment meeting.

This is a two-sided conversation in which everything can be discussed. During these interviews, the manager will discuss with the employee how he or she is developing and which competencies he or she may need to develop further. If necessary, additional coaching or training can be used for this.\n\nGi Group promotes education, courses and training for employees during their careers within the organization because we believe it is important that our employees are well qualified and keep up to date with developments in their field.

127,How is the availability organised for the client?,"We work with our onsite team in shifted shifts between 06:00 and 22:00 and work between 22:00 and 06:00 and with consignment shifts on weekends. As a result, we guarantee 100% accessibility for Clientand our flex workers. As mentioned earlier, we have a Back up in the Back up Team for every position. In an emergency, they will intervene in the consignment services and on-site staffing.\nThe Caretakers are always available 24/7 for our EU flex workers. They will also work in shifts, so that there is an eye for the human side and their private life.\nOur CAT (Central Administration Team) is available during office hours."
128,Can you describe your escalation model?,"Gi Group uses a communication matrix defined at the beginning of the collaboration. In addition, service reviews are held at least once a month. This is also used to check the KPIs and alignment to Service level Agreement. In the figure to the right, we have define the process, when dealing with and escalation. \n\nIn principle, all points of the escalation are processed in level 1 or 2. If there is no solution, the persons involved coordinate the integration of further necessary responsible persons.\nWe offer the Client directly a Senior Account Manager. TheSenior Account Manager is not in the operational line, but works from a helicopter view and acts from Gi Group Holding across the departments and brands. During the implementation phase, he or she will work closely with the Corporate Sales Manager, who takes the lead during the commercial process and therefore knows well what we have agreed and offered."
129,What kind of services does Gi Group provide to ensure quality by using KPI's?,"Services\n\nIn order to offer Clientthe region the desired service, we have determined a team composition and working method, partly on the basis of the information obtained. Mutual trust and the common goal to achieve the KPIs are central to this. The KPIs are a guideline and a compass for good performance, but in the end it is all about Client bringing in and retaining motivated people, with the right mindset. In addition to the hard KPI set, we also focus on the soft criteria to be able to meet the assignment. These two elements; KPIs on the one hand and people's motivation and mindset on the other are closely intertwined. Clienthas recorded many processes in the Flex Handbook, Gi Group will fully conform to this. That is the reason that a number of matters are not discussed in more detail in our action plan, such as consultation structure or KPIs.\nWe see KPIs as part of the toolkit to make increasingly smarter choices together, to keep each other sharp and as indicators to learn from or to identify. From our system, we are able to monitor a set of KPIs digitally and in real-time by means of clear dashboards, which can be fully adapted to the KPI set of Client. Via web portals Client's stakeholders have access to this dashboard, so that the Excel format, which is now used by Client, no longer has to be manually updated."
130,Can you describe your process of planning in practice?,"The success factors for making and executing the planning and pool management are communication (both to each other and to the internal organization, co-supplier and flex workers), and the planning tool\n• 5 days before the schedule is released, the team leaders have access. They must have entered the changes 2 days before the planning is due (think of dividing services, competences and positions according to your own wishes);\n• 4 days in advance we send out the planning for the following week;\n• The team leaders can always see in real time what is happening in the planning. So when we make a proposal for a change, the team leaders watch. We all see one schedule;\n• We distinguish two phases in our planning tool, namely proposal planning and actual planning;\n• After changes, we consult with the team leaders and they can refute changes within 24 hours. In short, we always keep in touch with the team leaders;\n• For each department, we schedule a short operational meeting with the team leaders once a week to discuss the changes;\n• The flex workers receive an email or text message with the services (in coordination with Client e-Commerce);\n• Pool management is organized on the basis of functions and availability;\n• Planning is organized on the basis of departments, teams, positions and competences.\n• Each flex worker receives 9 shifts per 2 weeks, which is an average of 35 hours per week. An extra shift must be requested when planning via the flex worker portal."
131,How can you support and advise the client in other ways?,"The Mysolution planning tool takes into account the applicable collective labor agreement, the Working Hours Act and other laws and regulations. Within the frameworks set by Client e-Commerce, flex employees have the option of self-rostering via PC, tablet and smartphone, with the 24/7 app, in the event of ad-hoc changes. If something changes in one timetable, the other timetables will automatically adjust accordingly. Gi Group advises Clienton planning and pool management on matters such as:\n• Where are the bottlenecks?\n• Where and when is cross training or training necessary?\n• When should recruitment start in order to anticipate peaks in time?\n• How can we improve forecasting together? (based on history)\n• What is the optimal pile composition and size?\n• Which mix of target groups works best per profile and / or department?"
132,How does Gi Group manage upscaling?,"If we have to scale up to 10%, we do this by increasing the capacity on recruitment or we choose to have every flex worker who wishes this work an extra shift within 2 weeks. So instead of running 9 shifts, running 10 shifts and rewarding the flex worker. All laws and regulations are always taken into account. The planning tool is designed for this."
133,How are holiday requests managed?,"Holiday requests must be requested at least 4 weeks in advance via the employee portal. You can easily submit the application in the flex worker portal. Within 3 working days, the flex worker will receive a response with any explanation. This is managed by our by Central Admin Team (CAT)."
134,How is absence managed?,"In the event of absence, a flex worker must notify us at least 3 hours prior to the start of the shift. This must be done by e-mail and the flex worker must be available by telephone. This is managed by by our Central Admin Team (CAT)."
135,Can you describe the administrative proces for temporary workers?,"CAT\nThe administrative process is completely taken over from the on-site team by our CAT (Central Administration Team) department, so that the on-site team can focus on account management and workforce management.\nThe CAT customers are our flex workers. The CAT arranges all administrative matters concerning flex workers (hirer's remuneration, contracts, time processing, wage payments, corrections, leave, illness, etc.) and maintains 1st-line contact with flex workers. In addition, the CAT ensures compliance with legislation, collective labor agreements, audits (SNA, NeN and ABU) and the guidelines of Client.\nSpecialists who focus on our administrative process work at the CAT, thereby reducing errors. Our specialism enables us to provide quick and effective answers to questions from our flex workers. Before the CAT can send a flex worker his or her employment contract for the digital signature, all mandatory and signed documents must be uploaded from the placement in the system.\nThe CAT follows the process that we have set up especially for Clientand is fully implemented in our HR software system Mysolution. This includes matters such as: resources issue forms, collective labor agreement, safety instructions, non-disclosure agreement, explanation of the portal and explanation of the planning and time registration. The documents and instructions are available to the flex worker at any time via the online candidate portal, which is also accessible via an app.\nThe safeguarding of all these process steps in Mysolution contributes to a positive experience for the flex worker regarding good employment practices from Gi Group."
136,Can you desribe retention within Gi Group?,"Retention\n\nLabor is human work. By giving flex workers the right attention, turnover, absenteeism and no show are reduced and involvement is increased. By creating a sustainable retention plan, we ensure that flex workers have and keep a bond with Clientand Gi Group. Focus on a longer stay, with 40 weeks becoming the norm instead of the current average of 34 weeks. That is our common goal.\nAfter the correct match, the guidance of the flex worker begins. The EU flex workers are welcomed upon arrival by a Caretaker who assigns them a room and offers a thorough welcome and bedding package containing:\n• New blankets\n• Two new sets of pillowcases and bottom sheets\n• A new pillow\n• An alarm clock with battery\n• Work shoes\n• T-shirts\nThe Caretaker ensures that the EU flex workers feel at home in their new home and shows them the way around them. On the first working day, the on-site team will introduce themselves and the buddy will go through the training process with the support of the team leader in accordance with the Client guidelines.\nThe flex workers receive an explanation about the Gi Group working method and portal and, in addition to the culture of Client e-Commerce, are also informed about the culture and standards of Gi Group. Of course we adhere to the guidelines from the Flex manual and the documentation of Client e-Commerce.\nWe focus on satisfaction because:\n• Gi Group is the official employer and attaches importance to satisfied flex workers;\n• A satisfied flex worker likes to go to work;\n• A satisfied flex worker performs better;\n• A satisfied flex worker is not very absent and stays longer at Client e-Commerce.\nThe Gi Group Onsite Manager, together with the Flex Team Lead and buddies, is responsible for guiding flex workers on the work floor. Based on this knowledge, a guidance process has been developed in which the flex worker is central.\n \nOur method of binding and retaining flex workers for Clientconsists of:\n• Maintain as much contact as possible with the flex workers and know what is going on. This in a smart mix of as much presence as possible, attention from the Caretaker and diversity in contact across modern online channels;\n• Streamlined onboarding; in which we offer clarity and structure in addition to a warm welcome;\n• Offer good housing with the possibility of private living; we do the same with transport;\n• Guidance for EU flex workers in applying for their BSN and bank account number;\n• Guiding any doctor, dentist or hospital visits;\n• Extra personal guidance during the arrival and training period\n• Extra attention around public holidays and holiday periods in connection with a higher risk of outflow;\n• Contact moment from Recruiter / Planner at the end of the first working day and first working week;\n• Providing Dutch language training from Shopper B and extra stimulation at Shopper C;\n• Show appreciation by means of Christmas gift, birthday card and reward for extra effort;\n• Conducting structural employee satisfaction surveys and acting appropriately on the results."
137,How is the onsite recruitment organised in combination with cross-border channels?,"Gi Group has arranged its recruitment on-site for Clientand focused on customer level.\nGi Group has an Onsite Recruitment Team (ORT). This is a centralized and specialized recruitment team of specific size, based on the location of the customer. The ORT enables us to scale up and down very quickly at the location of our client, because the Recruiters have a customer focus. The ORT is responsible, among other things, for recruitment, pre-selection, reference checks, talent pool management, possibly planning face-to-face conversations and coordinating the activities of the new arrivals on location. The ORT has the latest IT applications and, in addition to the traditional telephone line, also makes extensive use of WhatsApp (messages / video), SMS, Facebook and FaceTime.\nThe ORT can also use both online and offline channels. More details about the online channels and recruitment tools can be found in the chapter Innovation. Online channels include social media such as; Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn, but also channels such as www.gigroup.nl, Google Adds and our own database. In addition, job boards are also used. These are digital boards on which vacancies and CVs are published, for example Indeed, Neuvoo, Nationale Vacaturebank, Werk.nl and regional platforms. Offline channels are also actively used in campaigns. There are many ways to search for suitable candidates for a vacancy offline. For example, flyers are hung up and distributed around business parks, public buildings and supermarkets in the vicinity of the region. Vacancies are also published in local newspapers and referral campaigns are used (for example tell-a-friend promotions with a reward). When people receive recommendations from people they trust, they are more likely to take the step and continue.\nIn addition to our own Gi Group offices, we also use partners for recruitment abroad (8 countries) for EU flex workers."
138,Do you have a covid-19 protocol?,"We have a comprehensive covid-19 protocol, in which we have described per process step which instructions, tools, reports, form and rules apply. This is especially crucial for cross-border temp workers because they live and travel together. We have separate quarantine housing, where we can isolate people. We can provide a more detailed description if needed."
139,How can you support the client regarding Employer Branding?,"Our marketing specialists and our on-site team are happy to think along with Clientabout employer branding. Nowadays, whether or not an employer branding strategy makes the difference in a tight labor market.\nTogether with Clientwe make a SWOT analysis, in which the key points regarding why candidates want to work at Clientare incorporated. To be able to use objective data as a source, we work together with the Intelligence Group and Jobdigger and we use LinkedIn Insights.\nWe compare this SWOT analysis with a (local) competition analysis, after which we determine together which of the strengths we use in labor market communication, such as recruiting and SEO proof vacancy texts with an attractive layout, but also custom advertisements that we use via online and offline channels.\nIn order to arrive at the most effective mix of channels, we do AB tests where we try multiple channels and variations of advertisements so that we can measure what gives the best results. We always keep costs vs. the expected result in sharp focus. Because we can analyze all data in Mysolution, our HR software, in combination with the functionality of Saleforce Einstein (BI tools with AI functionality), we can use handy dashboards to see which campaigns are most successful.\nIn addition, it is important to understand the candidates, so that together we can make Clientmore interesting for them. Part of understanding the candidate is understanding where their interests lie. In addition, it is essential to look at where this specific group of candidates can be found, so on which platform and via which channel. With this information, suitable vacancies can be written on the right platforms.\nAnother option that Gi Group wants to roll out at Clientin the future is making videos about the flex workers who will start working at Client e-Commerce. This gives an idea of ??what a working day at Clientlooks like. Interviews can also be held with flex workers in which they can tell about their work experience and perception."
140,How does Gi Group organises housing in case of EU flexworkers?,"Every EU flex worker is maximally facilitated by us in his or her requirements to be able to work in the Netherlands and to be successful in the daily work at the customer. Our support of the people is focused on 5 things from which the customer reaps the benefits. Gi Group works together with permanent partners who provide us with quality accommodation. All locations of our partners are registered in the SNF location register. Gi Group sets high standards for the quality of the accommodation, location-bound facilities, the geographical location in relation to social facilities and the integration possibilities."
141,Where is the accommodation for the EU Flexworkers located?,"Our residential locations are centrally located and the regular facilities are within walking distance. We have opted for EU flex workers to be allowed to use the vehicles to go to the supermarket.\n\nBecause the location is central to the city center or the center, there is a greater chance of social integration. We encourage this at all times and our Caretakers support our flex workers in registering at the gym or going out with people to familiarize them with the neighborhood. A BRP registration is absolutely recommended and we guide our employees in this."
142,Is Gi Group cerfified in regard of housing?,"Gi Group is SNF certified and the last audit dates from April 8, 2021. We use the hiring register for this.\nAll residential locations independently carry the SNF quality mark and are registered in the location register of the Stichting Normering Flexwonen."
143,What kind of standards does Gi Group have regarding the occupation of rooms for EU flexworkers?,"Our starting point is that everyone has a single room, but here we are strongly dependent on the supply from the market. The long-stay homes at the location indicated above all offer single rooms, the cluster locations offer double rooms."
144,Is it possible for a EU flexworker to arrange private housing?,"If an EU flex worker does not wish to use our housing offer, this is a free choice. If a flex worker deems it desirable to be supported in the search for a private stay, we will assess the feasibility of this per situation. If the situation permits, we will always guide the flex worker in this"
145,How does Gi Group organise transportation for the flexworkers?,"Regarding mobility for our people, we work together with a number of partners who provide us with the means of transport that are no older than 3 months and meet all set safety standards.\nFor large volumes (> 150) we opt for a mix of mobility. We opt for a mix of fixed deployment supplemented with a shuttle service that provides flexibility.\nWe notice that a large number of cross-border employees do not have a valid European driving license. This makes it difficult to have a backup driver on every vehicle. We determine which vehicles to use on the basis of the candidates accepted. The choice for fixed bet is:\n• Bicycle\n• Car (4 persons per vehicle)\n• Bus (9 persons per vehicle)\n\nFor the flexibility and in case of short absence of both drivers on, for example, 1 car, employees can use the shuttle service that operates between the work location and the residential location. A bicycle is only offered if the home-work distance is no more than 5 kilometers one way. If someone wants to use his / her own transport, this is a free choice."
146,How are EU flexworkers attended during their stay?,"The guidance of migrant workers at residential locations is provided by the landlord in collaboration with Gi Group. All supervisors are pre-selected, hired and trained by the landlord. The employees are selected, hired and trained as supervisors.\n\nArrival\nUpon arrival at the location, residents are digitally registered at house and / or room level. Personal data is registered and a photo is taken and then the resident signs for approval. Upon signing, the house key is handed over and the rules and regulations are explained. After that, a confirmation will be sent to the resident by e-mail.\nMonitoring and registration\nTogether with the landlord, we record everything in the housing portal, so that we can register, trace and take action. The items below are re-registered.\n• Occupancy changes\n• Damages\n• Complaints\n• Warnings and / or misconduct\n \nEvery official warning issued by the supervisor at the location is registered in the portal, after which the resident automatically receives an email with the warning. Thanks to the integration with our own system, the registration is also recorded directly at a personal level. We say goodbye to the employee at three official warnings. If deportation follows, the employee will receive an e-mail and letter with the urgent request to leave the house within an agreed period of a maximum of 5 days.\nPolicy and control\nAt all locations, the policy of the landlord of the accommodations is followed and possibly supplemented by Gi Group. The residents are informed both orally and in writing in advance. Supervisors and our Caretakers do a weekly inspection round of the accommodations. Three aspects are assessed: order, hygiene and cleanliness. They keep track of this through issue management. All results are available in the portal and easy to check. All locations are manned 24/7 by at least 1 supervisor and 1 Caretaker. In case of escalation, security is always on standby.\n\nZero Tolerance\nAll locations have a Zero Tolerance policy regarding possession and / or use of drugs, public intoxication, violence, excessively aggressive behavior and sexual harassment. No written warnings will be issued for this, but deportation will immediately proceed."
147,How has Gi Group taken care of the insurance for her EU flexworkers?,"Every labor migrant receives standard health insurance from us. We arrange this at Holland Zorg. If an employee wishes to opt out of this, this must be indicated to us in writing. Gi Group receives a group discount of 5%, this discount is settled towards the flex workers."
148,Could you describe the recent innovations of Gi Group?,"Our organization is fully specialized in (onsite) services to companies in the production and logistics sector. For that reason, our unique delivery model is scalable, so that we can easily ""move"" with the extreme peak requirements known within these sectors. This enables us to manage both the on-site team and our centrally organized teams around activities such as; quickly scaling up recruitment (local and in Europe), planning and administration in capacity, enabling us to deliver large volumes of flex workers and guaranteeing quality. Across all these processes, we offer added value to all parties involved in this chain, because we have housed all our applications and data flows on one digital platform in the user-friendly Salesforce environment, enabling us to offer uniformity, insight and control over all processes related to inflow, throughflow and outflow of flexible hiring, by making this data accessible via handy web portals. Below is a selection of some innovations that we deploy for our customers on our Mysolution platform."
149,Does Gi Group provide a client portal?,"Gi Group uses Mysolution, the best all-in-one HR solution for agencies available on the Dutch market, where front, mid and back office data is integrated into one system on the Salesforce platform. All our functionalities are integrated in the same environment, so we support a full life cycle of the data and connect all points. Instead of just using the standard Mysolution functionalities, we have added a large number of supporting applications, such as; Salesforce Einstein, OnRecruit, Company.info, Jobdigger, Intelligence Group, Avnio, InGoedeBanen, etc. Another valuable application of Mysolution is that we can build a custom made portal for Client e-Commerce, where we can parts in the Salesforce environment such as a real-time planning overview, management reports, KPI dashboards and job tracking, but also more basic data such as; average hourly rate, average multiplier, the number of hours per type per week per department, etc."
150,Does Gi Group use other innovative recruitment tools?,"We have integrated the NIXZ recruitment robot into our process to automate simple repetitive tasks. Once we have taught NIXZ what to do, the robot will take over the basic tasks of our recruitment department. When we give the NIXZ robot a job opening, it checks the Indeed database for suitable candidates, checks of the candidates are already in our system, if so; it checks whether the candidates have not yet been commissioned, if so; it sends an automated message via WhatsApp / email if the candidate wants to work for your group, if not; it asks a Recruiter to send a message from the Indeed platform. The advantage for Clientis that we can scale up more than 35% faster because the robot takes over repetitive tasks."
151,How do you register agreements made between Gi Group and the client?,The Service Level Agreement (SLA) is the most important document between Client and Gi Group and describes the cooperation and agreements between both parties. The purpose of an SLA is to make binding agreements about the quality parameters of the service and about the reports. The performance and services provided are continuously measured with Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that are defined in the SLA. We are happy to determine the content of this document together with Client.
152,"How are gathered data (KPI, financial) communicated to the client?","We see reports as a means and not as an end. We monitor the established (and standard) KPIs per customer, such as:\n• degree of the number of orders\n• degree of filling of vacancies\n• degree of mission interruptions\n• degree of absenteeism\n• quality level and evaluation at the end of the mission\n• occupational accidents\nWe report on these KPIs during the consultation moments. This always goes in two ways; what is the number and what does the number say. What we mean by this is that it is good to report what the degree of fulfillment is, but it is more important to know why it changes, why it is different from other companies (or not) and what we can do about it together .\nReports are based on a PowerPoint presentation per KPI:\n• Result KPI\n• Reason KPI\n• Improve action"
153,How does Gi Group accompany / guide the flexworker during his work?,"Thanks to our many years of experience, we know exactly what the temporary worker expects from us as an employer. Based on this knowledge, a guidance process has been developed in which the temporary worker is central.\n1. Guidance during the induction process by the Consultant.\n2. Contact moment at the end of the first working day and working week by the Consultant.\n3. Check for need / motivation for training by the Consultant.\n4. Monitoring progress during a training by Consultant.\n5. Contact moment at the end of the trial period by the Consultant with the manager Client.\n6. End of the first month of probation interview by Consultant.\n7. Structured evaluation moments (every quarter) by the Consultant.\n8. Compliance with the Client assessment system by Consultant.\n9. Christmas gift and birthday card by the Consultant.\n10. Employee satisfaction survey by the Consultant."
154,Are exit interviews done by Gi Group?,"If a temporary worker or Gi Group decides to stop working, an exit interview will always take place. The results of an exit interview will be discussed with the relevant manager and included in the quarterly evaluation. Striking matters will also be directly fed back to HR. If a decision is taken by Client that the temporary worker must stop his activities, a reason will be issued from Client to Gi Group. Client must also adhere to the notice periods for termination of the assignment in the ABU CLA."
155,Can you describe your recruitment process?,"Even before recruitment starts, we start with proper preparation. This preparation is crucial in our operation to guarantee the correct quality afterwards.\nWe first want to get to know you as well as possible.\nFor this we work with various tools. On the one hand, we have our 'feel the job'. Here we let our dedicated consultant work on the shop floor for a (half) day to get to know the job, but also the surrounding culture, the team members, the atmosphere as well as possible.\nWith this information, as well as on the basis of conversations with HR, people who exercise the position or a team leader, we draw up a ""Culture scan"". In this we ask ourselves questions such as: How do they work at Client, who works at Client, what makes someone fit for Client?\nIn addition, we also prepare a ""Talent Scan"". This is our guide to selecting the right profile for a specific position. We assess both the hard facts, such as experience and skills, we take references where possible, but also the soft skills such as motivation, attitude, and does someone fit into the Client culture (checked in our ""Culture scan"")\nFrom this knowledge we start our search. We focus on looking for the right intake as well as actively looking for the right candidates on the market. We find it important in our search to always work from the right employer brand and to present our customer, Client, in the correct way. Each candidate goes through the following steps with us, in order to keep our quality high: CV screening + interview by phone, personal interview with consultant (during COVID only by phone), reference check, discussing vacancy and company. We believe it is important to treat our candidates as clients. We receive our candidate temporary employees at the office or at our client for a personal interview in which we elaborate on the previous points. In addition, we believe it is important to keep the ""customer experience"" of our candidate as high as possible. This also means that a candidate who is not selected for a vacancy at Client will receive constructive feedback as well as a number of other vacancies. In this way, our candidates maintain a positive feeling towards us as an office, as well as towards Client."
156,What is your added value within Fashion & Luxury?,"We offer our clients a dedicated team of recruiters, who are highly skilled and specialized in the fashion and luxury sector, that can assist you with the following projects:\n• Finding the best candidates for In-Store roles and headquarter roles for  temporary staffing based on short term placements.\n• We use a business intelligence tool for insights in the local labor market, vacancies and competitors.\n• Finding the best candidates for In-Store roles and headquarter roles for temporary staffing based on a temping of secondment (fixed hours) concept.\n• Finding the best candidates for In-Store and head- quarter roles for permanent based on long-term placements.\n• We can accomplish a single assignment for 1 specific role or create a whole new team of several roles for new store openings.\n• In a partnership, we can spend time helping with branding and exposure to help stores on local level.\n• Free Consulting regarding recruitment processes and the market in local countries.\n• We have a wide variety of training options for Sales Advisors, Beauty Advisors or management training to Floor Managers, Assistant Store Manager and Store Managers. Together with Client, we draw up a training plan per profile/group, whereby we will make full use of the training reservation of 1.02% of the gross salary in phase A."
157,Could you get governmental funds and let the Client benefit from these subsidies / grants?,"We propose to distribute the following subsidies, which are paid out and apply to the population of flex workers who work at the Client 50/50 through Gi Group. The Client will then receive the 50% part of the subsidy after it has been paid to Gi Group. \n\nLoonkostenvoordeel:\n• Rijksoverheid: https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/wet-tegemoetkomingen-loondomein-wtl/tegemoetkoming-loonkosten-oudere-jongere-of-gehandicapte-werknemers/loonkostenvoordelen-lkv \n\nLage inkomensvoordeel (LIV)\n• Rijksoverheid: https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/wet-tegemoetkomingen-loondomein-wtl/tegemoetkoming-loonkosten-oudere-jongere-of-gehandicapte-werknemers/lage-inkomensvoordeel-liv \n\nJeugd-LIV\n• Rijksoverheid: https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/wet-tegemoetkomingen-loondomein-wtl/tegemoetkoming-loonkosten-oudere-jongere-of-gehandicapte-werknemers/tegemoetkoming-verhoging-minimumjeugdloon-jeugd-liv"
158,What recruitment channels do you use for personel in the beauty and fashion industry?,"• Job boards; We have accounts on multiple platforms and job crawlers.\n• LinkedIn; Using Job slots and our recruiting sheets for pro-active hunting.\n• Social Media; We use Instagram ads and Facebook ads.\nAlso: posting and sharing the vacancies in the hot Facebook groups related to Fashion, Beauty, Retail and Jobs.\n• Store to Store Hunting & Mystery shopping; We take the time to approach good candidates in stores and convince them to work for Client and do mystery shopping to test the potential candidates we have in mind.\n• Our Network; We have a very big network.

We can operate from every city in the country.\n• Competence Ranker; We ask which competences Client finds important.\nWe will do our interview based on these competences through our STAR-technique."
159,Could you explain how you will do the planning and the management of the pool of beauty advisors?,"The success factors for making and executing the planning and poolmanagement are always communication and the planning tool; communication towards each other, towards the internal organization and towards the Beauty Advisors. The Retail Managers will have their own access to the portal, so they can always see in real-time what is happening in the planning, so when we make a proposal for a change in the planning, the Retail Managers will see the change. Also the replacements of Beauty Advisors due to sickness or other reasons are facilitated by the system, because the poolmanagement functionality is integrated and highly automated. Of course, the personal contact between the Beauty Advisors and our Flexpool Coordinators is still mandatory to check the daily presence, make agreements and confirm shifts.\n\nWe stay in personal touch with the Beauty Advisors in the pool by telephone, WhatsApp, SMS, Socials or other popular channels through a fixed schedule. We also send out automated, but personalized messages at important moments such as birthdays, graduation and new year transition. The aim is to maintain the pool. The options for retaining this target group can also include a reward system that can be saved for something per hour worked. This will certainly ensure maintenance of the pool during a low season.\n\nOur Flexpool Coordinators, that take care of planning and poolmanagement, work in shifts, 7 days a week and are also reachable after office hours. Besides the extra service our Flexpool Coordinators already cover, our portal also offers a 1st line self-support as an IT solution between 22:00 and 06:00. The self-support functionality meets the replacement demand, by automatically sending a message to the reserve pool of candidates, allowing available flex workers to schedule themselves to fill the shift. Thanks to this automated smart tooling, any other candidates who have also responded will be unsubscribed and the shift will be confirmed to the flex worker who acted the fastest. The system rewards the most flexible flex workers. A lot is possible in the field of rewarding the Beauty Advisors in the pool, but we are happy to discuss this in person with Client."

The test policy is described in accordance with the applicable RIVM policy. This means that the testing policy can change if the situation in the Netherlands changes. RIVM guidelines are leading in this. \n• Each new arrival (from a yellow area) is tested via a rapid test before entering the residential location. The test is performed by the Caretaker. In case of a positive test result, the employee is placed in quarantine. An employee who suffers from a cold or a fever must report this immediately to cpa@gigroup.com \n• CPA will forward the report to the Gi Group corona contact point; \n• The corona contact point (Gi Group) interacts with the GGD and immediately follows up on the advice of the GGD; \n• Employees have themselves tested immediately and move to the isolation home within 48 hours pending the results; \n• Until the result is known, the employee with symptoms will stay in the isolation home; \n• If the test result is positive, the employee will stay in the isolation home and will update the corona contact person 3 times a day about the developments.

The employee can resume work the following day. Besides, every accommodation has a list of products to prevent transmission; Quick tests, non medical masks, gloves, handalcohol gel, contactinformation medical contacts, poster of the Covid-19 measures of the house or car and flyers with the measures.

For instance we can show you the average hourly rate, the average multiplier, the amount of hours per week per department"
166,Could you describe how you retain the workers?,"Labor is human work. By giving flex workers the right attention, turnover, absenteeism and no show are reduced and involvement is increased. By drawing up a retention plan, we ensure that the flex workers have a bond with Client  and Gi Group. Four needs are central to the retention plan; work, pay, attention and development.\n\nAfter the right match, the guidance of the flex workers begins. Gi Group guides the flex workers placed at Client  in a human, yet structured way. The flex workers are guided because:\n• Gi Group wants to contribute to the labor market and develop and train flex workers based on this core value;\n• Gi Group is the official employer and attaches importance to satisfied flex workers;\n• A satisfied flex worker likes to go to work;\n• A satisfied flex worker performs better;\n• A satisfied flex worker is not very absent and stays longer at Client .\nThe Gi Group Onsite Consultants are responsible for guiding flex workers. The Onsite Consultants are the experts in this field and are supported by our colleagues from the staff departments at the head office. Thanks to our many years of experience, we know exactly what our flex workers expect from us as an employer. Based on this knowledge, a coaching process has been developed in which the flex worker is central.\n\nMaintain as much contact as possible with the flex workers and know what is going on.

167,Could you describe your recruitment and selection proces?,"Gi Group has a Central Recruitment Team (CRT). This is a centralized and specialized recruitment team of serious size, based in Amsterdam. Thanks to the CRT, we are able to scale up and down very quickly for our customers, because we can schedule recruiters in blocks of 3 hours for our customers throughout the Netherlands. The CRT is responsible for recruitment, pre-selection, reference checks, talent pool management and the scheduling of face-to-face conversations with our Onsite Consultants. The CRT has the latest IT applications and, in addition to the traditional telephone line, also makes extensive use of WhatsApp (messages / video), SMS, Facebook and FaceTime.\n\nThe CRT uses both online and offline channels. Online channels include social media such as; Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn, but also channels such as www.gigroup.nl, Google Adds and our own database. In addition, job boards are also used. These are digital boards on which vacancies and CVs are published, for example Indeed, Neuvoo, Nationale Vacaturebank, Werk.nl and regional platforms. Offline channels are also actively used in campaigns. There are many ways to search for suitable candidates offline for a vacancy. For example, flyers are hung up and distributed around business parks, public buildings and supermarkets where Client 's competitors are located. Vacancies are also published in local newspapers and referral campaigns are used (for example tell-a-friend promotions with a reward). When people get recommendations from people they trust, they are more likely to take the step.\n\nAfter the pre-selection on hard criteria by the CRT, the interviews are scheduled by the CRT for the Onsite Consultant, who then makes the final match on soft criteria. The live interviews always take place on-site at Client . The Onsite Consultant knows exactly what Client  is looking for, who fits the culture and values of Client  and knows not only the measurable competences, but also the softer characteristics that make an employee suitable for the vacancy. By conducting the interview in a structured way using smart interview techniques (for example STAR), we get a reliable picture of the behavior of an applicant in work situations. If large groups have to enroll at the same time, we sometimes choose to organize group sessions. We sometimes use assessments for more complex roles."
168,How do you provide the Client with labor market information?,"TEST TEST Gi Group has integrated the Intelligence Group target group dashboard, so that we have all the necessary information regarding supply analysis, labor market analysis and target group analysis. This gives Gi Group a detailed and realistic picture of the job market in the Franeker region and gives Client an advantage over competing companies in the region looking for the same type of profiles. We can even map the current employment conditions of the companies in the region using public data that is accessible to us. Some examples of data are: • Insight into recruitment feasibility: what percentage of your target group is actively and / or latently looking? How scarce is your talent? How often are these accessed? • Insight into where and how you can reach your target group: through which media channels can I reach the active and latent target group? Which (pull) factors set him or her in motion? What are their hobbies and interests? • Insight into the (regional) labor market: what is the average salary offered? Who are your competitors? How long are vacancies open on average? • The right target group information to manage realistic expectations towards Client ."

170,What contribution could you have to the employer branding of Client ?,"Our marketing specialists and your Onsite Consultant are happy to think along with Client  about employer branding. Nowadays, an employer branding strategy or no employer branding strategy makes the difference in a tight labor market, even now that more people are available due to the Corona pandemic. We see significant discrepancies in attracting and retaining talent between companies with a strong brand name, culture and large marketing budget and those that do not have this advantage.\nTogether with Client  we make a SWOT analysis, in which the key points related to; “Why candidates would like to work at Client ” has been incorporated. We compare this SWOT analysis with a (local) competition analysis, after which we determine together which of the strengths we use in labor market communication, such as recruiting and SEO proof vacancy texts with an attractive layout, but also custom advertisements that we use via online - and offline channels. We also determine together with Client  which channel mix we will use. To arrive at a channel mix, we do AB tests, in which we try multiple channels and variants of advertisements, so that we can measure what gives the best results in the Franeker region. We always keep costs vs. the expected result sharp in the eye. Because we can analyze all data in Mysolution, our HR software, handy dashboards allow us to see which campaigns are most successful. After we have determined the employer branding strategy together with Client , we make an action plan and a schedule. Employer branding is a fixed item on the agenda below during our meetings.\nFrom our vision, employer branding can only be achieved if the internal organization supports this image and there is commitment at all levels; before and during the execution, both on the side of Client , and on the side of Gi Group. Communication of texts, images and videos are especially important during the recruitment and selection phase. But what was communicated during recruitment and selection must become apparent in reality during the introduction, the induction process, development and in the working environment at Client . External communication is about what, but especially how you communicate. The content must be consistent, honest and in line with the culture, target audience and predetermined message. In addition, the form also determines to a large extent how the message comes across. Who's speaking? What's the tone? How does it look? For example, do you want to position yourself as a young, innovative organization with a focus on fun? Then the communication must radiate this. Is development one of your spearheads? Then make sure that this is reflected again and again in your communication.\n\nIn addition, it is important to understand the candidates, so that together we can make Client  more interesting for them. Part of understanding the candidate is understanding where their interests lie. In addition, it is essential to look at where this specific group of candidates can be found, so on which platform. With this information, suitable vacancies can be written on the right platforms.\nAnother possibility that Gi Group hopes to put into practice in the future at Client  is to make videos about the temporary workers who will start working at Client . This gives an idea of what a working day at Client  looks like. Interviews can also be held with the temporary workers, in which they can tell about their work experience and perception.\nFinally, we will look together at a content strategy and we can advise Client  on how smart more attention can be paid to increasing brand awareness on social media. Ultimately, we can only be successful in employer branding and marketing if our team can work closely with the team within Client  who is responsible for this."
171,How do you guarantee the quality and functioning of the temp workers?,"Recruitment\n• During the recruitment of flex workers, various steps have been built in to check the quality of the temporary worker in advance;\n• Telephone screening (availability, willingness to work shifts, motivation, certificates, language, etc.);\n• Reference check;\n• Face2face intake at location Client  by Onsite Consultant (deeper into competencies, shifts, motivation, culture match, general impression);\n• Conduct (language) tests or assessments for senior and office positions.During the recruitment of flex workers, various steps have been built in to check the quality of the temporary worker in advance:\n• Telephone screening (availability, willingness to work shifts, motivation, certificates, language, etc.);\n• Reference check;\n• Face2face intake at location Client  by Onsite Consultant (deeper into competencies, shifts, motivation, culture match, general impression);\n• Conduct (language) tests or assessments for senior and office positions.\n\nInterim assesment \nInterim assessment is always in consultation with the customer, as an assessment system has often already been set up. Gi Group's standard procedure is as follows:\n• Evaluation first day (by telephone by Onsite Consultant)\n• Evaluation first week (by phone by Onsite Consultant)\n• Evaluation first month (preferably on site by Onsite Consultant, if desired with the manager of the flex worker)\n• Evaluation after six months (on location by Onsite Consultant, preferably together with the flexworker's manager)\n• Annual evaluation (on location by Onsite Consultant, preferably together with the flexworker's manager)\nAll assessments and communication are recorded in Mysolution, Gi Group's HR system.\n\nOngoing processes\nIn addition to the formal evaluations, the Gi Group Onsite Consultant also regularly has an informal conversation with the managers and flex workers, so that any pain points are quickly identified. Our goal is to be on site as much as possible, especially during shift changes, so that we hit the people.\n\nTraining \nTogether with Client , we draw up a training plan per profile per person, whereby we will fully utilize the training reservation of 1.02% of the gross salary in phase A.\n\nReports\nIn line with the agreed meeting structure, a report will be published in which the assessments are communicated. These reports also include details such as absenteeism, not showing up, arriving late, etc. We would like to talk to Client  about the requirements and wishes regarding this report."
172,How do you think you can spend the 1.02% training reservation for training at Client ?,"Schooling reservation for training is a very important ingredient to bind and captive flex workers. Specialized technical knowledge is a great addition to the production at Client . We propose to select flex workers together with Client  and to annually offer a group of outstanding people (as a guideline the aforementioned evaluations) a training course, for example Operator MBO 3, or another training that meets Client 's training needs. In doing so, the flex workers become more specialists, all-rounder deployable in the pool and Client  can offer them career opportunities, increasing the chance of Client  retaining these stars.\nAnother group we can offer language training, safe working training, forklift or manager training. This is in consultation with Client  to give shape, whereby the outcome of the evaluations of the temporary workers also indicate a direction.\n\nWe can also use DOORZAAM schooling cheques. DOORZAAM's mission is to stimulate the sustainable employability of flex workers. Stimulating and promoting sustainable employability involves career, learning, development, health and finances. DOORZAAM distributes training vouchers to temporary employment organizations as a financial support for flex workers. The flex worker can use the voucher to choose one or more training courses, courses or training courses up to a maximum of € 500 incl. VAT. Upon receipt of these training vouchers, Gi Group will also make them available to flex workers deployed at Client .\nDOORZAAM: https://www.doorzaam.nl/loopbaan/scholingsvouchers/."
173,What posseblities and experience do you have with the training of forklift drivers and operators?,"The costs for lift, reach or narrow aisle truck training are fully covered by Gi Group from the budget of the 1.02% training reservation that we build up for flex workers in phase A (78 weeks). We train a large part of our logistics temporary workers through BLOM training courses. At the request of our client, this can of course also be done via another training institute in the Client region.\nTogether with Client , we can select temporary workers and annually offer a group of excellence (as a guideline the aforementioned evaluations) training, for example Operator MBO 3. In doing so, they become more specialist and Client  can offer them career opportunities, thereby increasing the chance of retaining these excellence by Client .\nAn example of a training that we regularly purchase for our customers in the production sector is:https://www.opleiding.nl/opleiding/mbo-vakopleiding-procesverbetering.html?open=brochure-lite&course=a9f3a7ac-78ba-4c8a-819e-42658a9b0f73 \nThis training is at MBO-3 level, but shortened to the essential courses that are required for process operators and the costs are approximately € 2,630. A full MBO-3 training for process operator costs € 6,685. For the latter training it is a requirement that Client  is a recognized training company. We are happy to coordinate with Client  the exact percentage that Gi Group takes care of for this type of training, because this depends on how the total training budget is spent and for this we must first properly map out the volumes and wishes."
174,In what way and with what means do you guarantee optimal onboarding of new employees and what can this all include?,"Sales\nIn our opinion, the design of the onboarding already starts with the start-up of a new customer. Sales has answered the questions from the customer during the commercial process and, together with operations, devised the solution in the form of related services. The agreements are laid down in an SLA and this is offset by a tariff. This information is entered by sales in Mysolution, our HR software, where the entire cycle of processes from inflow, throughflow to outflow and invoicing come together. Sales always remains closely involved during the implementation phase and works together with operations. Sales organizes a handover meeting, where all information is shared and discussed with colleagues from all departments such as; operation, recruitment, planning, finance and administration.\n\nRecruitment\nRecruitment also plays an important role in informing flex workers, because recruitment establishes the first contacts with the prospective flex workers for Client . The recruiters must therefore be well informed about all the ins & outs at Client  and maintain short lines of communication with the Onsite Consultants.\n\nCPA\nThe administrative process is completely taken over by the Onsite Consultant by our CPA department, so that the Onsite Consultant can focus on account management and workforce management. CPA has no contact with the customer, but only with the flex workers. CPA takes care of all administrative matters concerning flex workers (hirer's remuneration, contracting, time processing, wage payments, corrections, leave, illness, etc.) and maintains the 1st line of communication with the flex workers. As a result, we deploy specialists in the administrative process, which reduces the error margins and the flex workers have quick answers to their questions. Before CPA can send a flex worker his or her employment contract for the digital signature, all mandatory and signed documents must be uploaded from the placement in the system and CPA must follow all instructions that we have specified specifically for Client  in Mysolution our HR -software. Think of things like; deposit forms, collective labor agreement, safety instructions, non-disclosure agreement, explanation, planning, time registration and company assets, such as shoes and clothing. We make a working-by-booklet especially for Client , in which the most important things are clearly described. The Onsite Consultant goes through this work-by-booklet extensively with the flex worker. These documents and instructions are easy to find for flex workers at any time via the online candidate portal, which is also accessible via an app. The safeguarding of all these process steps in Mysolution contributes to a positive experience for the flex worker of the onboarding.\n\nOnsite operation\nIn our opinion, nothing beats personal contact, so our Onsite Consultants are often on-site during the onboarding and induction period to inform, guide and answer questions for the flex workers. In this we always look for the triangle with production and HR of Client , because only together we can optimally fulfill this period of information and instruction."
175,"Do you already have (potential) vendors in the region Friesland for more technical profiles, in case you will be rewarded as a Master Vendor?","Yes, we agree with this.\nYes, we have both local partners and nationally operating partners. In the answer we primarily focus on our technical partners, as we expect to mainly need support from our partner database in the field of the heavier profiles, such as TD and experienced Operator.\nA selection of our technical partners:\n• Xelvin\n• Jobz-on\n• IJssel Technology\n• Techsharks\n• AB Vakwerk"
176,Does Gi Group has experience with managing Vendor as a Master Vendor?,"Yes, Gi Group is responsible for managing the sub-suppliers.\nIn concrete terms, this means that we apply the same rates and conditions to the sub-suppliers, as agreed between Client  and Gi Group. Gi Group will also take care of all communication towards the sub-suppliers, about operational matters such as; vacancies, onboarding and planning, so that Client  only has one single point of contact, namely the Gi Group Onsite Consultant."
177,"Given the information in the introduction and your own knowledge of Client ; is the ""traditional"" in-house role necessary in your view? If not, how do you organize the necessary attention, if so how would you implement the in-house role? Which tasks, roles, activities contribute most to Client 's goals?","In our opinion, the onsite model is the only way to properly implement the HR partnership that Huhthamaki aspires to. Gi Group therefore does not have a branch network and is always onsite with its customers, whereby the onsite presence is linked to the hours per week. The close interdependence between the two organizations in the deployment of a large group of flex workers on the basis of posting in a so-called triangular employment relationship, combined with the requirements and wishes with regard to service provision from Client , means that regular but efficient communication is the only key to success. The Corona pandemic has taught the world to adapt to more remote communication through channels like; Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Skype for Business, etc. What has also become clear is that personal physical contact on the work floor is indispensable to strengthen a relationship and to arrive at creative solutions together.\n\nHowever, these activities can easily be done from a distance, such as:\n• Search\n• Pre-selection\n• Assessments\n• Marketing\n• Administration \n• Report\n• Planning and pool management\n• Replace no shows\n• Master Vendor service\n• Show up checks \n\nActivities, where onsite presence is required, are: \n• Implementation and migration\n• Final selection rounds\n• Introduction (onboarding, instructions)\n• Tours \n• Company equipment; safety shoes, uniforms, PBM, access cards, etc.\n• Schooling \n• Show up checks \n• Evaluations and assessments \nWork meetings (weekly, monthly, quarterly) We can also perform the above activities that are mentioned in the case of physical on-site presence, remotely. However, we strongly prefer to carry out these activities on-site with a physical presence."
178,Your organization provides continuity guarantees regarding (whether or not part-time) in-house occupancy and / or the local location. Explain how your organization deals with (guaranteed) qualitative and quantitative presence at the in-house and location.,"With a volume of 60,000 hours per year, converted 1,150 per week, Gi Group guarantees an in-house occupation of at least 2 days per week. Due to the flexibility in our model, we can easily adapt our in-house presence to the needs during peak times, during implementation and migration and during final selection interview rounds.\nThanks to our onsite model with mobile consultants, who are supported and unburdened by the CRT, CPA the Flexpool Coordinators and our Staff departments, we are generally more present in-house than our competitors with a volume of 60,000 hours per year. The presence and occupation of the in-house office partly depends on the number of flex hours per week. If the number of hours falls below the number agreed in writing (60,000 hours / year), Gi Group reserves the right to adjust the daily staffing accordingly.\nWe will involve Client  in the process of selecting a suitable in-house employee."
179,Could you describe in a short process flow what your process of planning and pool management will look like in the context of Client 's desired planning methodology described in the introduction (planning for availability and competences across departments and teams)?,"The success factors for making and executing the planning and pool management are always communication and the planning tool, both towards each other, and towards the internal organization and flex workers. Because we still have insufficient knowledge of the planning processes at Client  at this stage, other than what is described in the RFP documentation, it is difficult to create a process flow. We have therefore based the process flow below on the basis of our knowledge and experiences with similar production customers.\n\n1. 1 week before planning, a proposal planning is made by Gi Group based on the forecast from Client ;\n2. When the proposal schedule is ready, it is available to the team leaders within 48 hours. The team leaders have access via their own login to our planning system to make real-time adjustments;\n3. The team leaders have access 5 days before the planning starts. 2 days before the planning starts, they must have entered the changes (think of dividing services, competencies and positions according to their own wishes)\n4. We send out planning 2 days in advance for two weeks later;\n5. The team leaders can always monitor in real-time what is happening in the planning, so when we make a proposal for a change, the team leaders are also watching. We all see one schedule;\n6. We distinguish two phases in our planning system, namely proposal planning and actual planning;\n7. After changes, we consult with the team leaders and these changes can be refuted within 24 hours. In short, we always keep in touch with the team leaders;\n8. Per department, we schedule a short operational meeting with the team leaders once a week to discuss the changes;\n9. The flex workers receive an email or text message with the services (in coordination with Client );\n10. Pool management is organized on the basis of functions and availability;\n11. Planning is organized on the basis of departments, teams, positions and competences.\n\nThe Mysolution planning tool takes into account the applicable collective labor agreement, the Working Hours Act and other laws and regulations. Within the frameworks set by Client , employees have the option of self-rostering via PC, tablet and smartphone, with the 24/7 app, in the event of ad hoc changes. If something changes in one timetable, the other timetables will automatically adjust accordingly. Gi Group advises Client  on planning and pool management on matters such as: \n• Where are the bottlenecks?\n• Where and when is cross training / education necessary?\n• When should recruitment start in order to anticipate peaks in time?\n• How can we improve forecasting together? (based on history)\n• What is the optimal pile composition and size?\n• Which mix of target groups works best per profile and / or department?"
180,With what planning system do you operate and is the opportunity there fort he customer to make use of that system (in the future)?,"Planning system\nWe work with our own planning system, integrated in the cloud solution of Mysolution, which forms the heart of our digital front, mid and back office. This is the best HR software on the market for HR service providers. The team leaders in production also get their own login to the planning system, to make real-time adjustments and always see what is happening in the planning (see the answers to questions 12 and 22 for more information about the planning system. ).\nClock system\n\nWe also propose the clock system to implement Nedap's PEP Flex.\nFlex workers clock in and out with their \npersonal PEP card at a PEP Reader.\n\nPEP registers the clocked hours of the flex workers. The hours are approved by those responsible and then go to the salary package in Mysolution and Gi Group that can process the hours for invoicing.\n\nThe PEP system also keeps track of the contract hours and leave balances. This is always clear to those involved.\n\nClocking in on the PEP Readers can be done upon arrival, but can also be done by cost plate, line or activity, for example. The readers are equipped with a battery and make contact with one PEP gateway that collects all information and sends it to the PEP software. The collection and forwarding is done via the GPRS network by means of a SIM card that is built into the gateway. This will give you a wealth of information about how much and how long work has been carried out to cost center / activity level.\n\nIn addition, the manager has the option to view all hours worked in the current and previous weeks of the employee. The hours and entitlements accrued are also transparent. Both the accrued hours / rights and hours worked and allowances are transparent to the employee. It is possible for the manager to make a total overview of the hours worked and to export this. PEP Flex is already linked to Mysolution, so that we can digitally enter the hours via an interface. This reduces the error margins and we can see in real time who is clocked in, which makes attendance checks a lot easier. Running reports is also easy. \nThe costs for the implementation and use of PEP Flex are already included in our pricing."
181,"Client  has a flat hiring pattern with peaks during Easter, Christmas and during the holiday period. How can you guarantee that as many of the same, well-worked-in forces are used again?","The basics of qualitative pool management is good and frequent communication with the candidates in the pool. The communication is a mix of personal contact through channels, such as; telephone, email, WhatsApp, SMS and social media and automated messages via SalesForce Pardot, our marketing automation tool, which is fully integrated into our HR software Mysolution. If you give enough attention to the candidates in the pool, the pool will remain more filled and up to date. Both the Central Recruitment Team and the Onsite Consultants have a role in pool management. Below we describe three solutions to bind well-developed forces so that they can be used again at a later stage.\nShield model \nBy using a shell model, in which we apply 4 layers in the pool, we can better categorize and retain flex workers. Not everyone wants to work as many hours a week as possible.\na. Permanent employees of Client ;\nb. (Almost) full-time flex workers; create volume in the workforce; also by not always deploying everyone full-time, so that a surplus in the pool becomes available. This keeps the quality and stability high;\nc. Part-time flex workers; for peaks in the week and weekends.\nd. Holiday forces / peak forces; flex workers only used to absorb peak times and holidays. In addition to students, you can also think of part-time parents or state pensioners.\n\nReservation of over hours \nWhat we also use for our customers is to encourage the flex workers in layer D to work overtime, so that after the peak, we pay these hours in phases in order to keep this group of flex workers longer with Client .\nPool sharing\nA third solution is the use of pool sharing, whereby the flex workers are also deployed at other Gi Group customers. For flex workers living independently in the Netherlands, we combine working at Client  with work within a maximum travel time of 45 minutes, but for migrant workers, for whom we also provide housing, transport, insurance, etc., this is possible with our customers throughout the Netherlands. . If we also deploy labor migrants at Client , Gi Group can have the machine instructions translated into English, so that we can also deploy English-speaking flex workers during peak times."
182,How do you specifically plan to build up the flex pool of students and the holiday pool?,"Recruitment\nThis target group of students requires a different approach than we use for regular vacancies. For this target group we make more use of social media channels such as Instagram, Snapchat, Tiktok,etc. Possibilities for offline campaigns (such as at MBO / HBO schools, universities, sports associations or other channels) are also included.\nFrom reports displayed by our recruitment software, we can immediately measure and manage the success factors during each campaign.\n\nKeeping contact \nKeep in touch with the pool by telephone, WhatsApp, SMS or other popular channels through a fixed schedule. And send automated, but personalized messages at important moments such as birthdays, graduation, new year transition. The aim is to maintain the pool.\n\nReward system \nThe options for retaining this target group can also include a reward system that can be saved for something per hour worked. This will certainly ensure maintenance of the pool in the summer period."
183,"Could you work out a concise action plan for the implementation period, including a migration plan?","1. A planning including a well-developed communication and migration plan, including concrete detailed steps, milestones and a critical path, in which it is clear that the (activities for the) implementation will be ready within 8 weeks.\n2. The composition of a dedicated project team, including one central contact person;\n3. A description of the manner of aftercare after the implementation phase;\n4. A description of what is expected of the customer during this period.\n\nIn our opinion, a successful implementation / migration consists of 5 elements:\n1. A qualitative implementation team, composed of experienced professionals (at all levels), who have already completed many migrations;\n2. A migration team that is already involved during the RFP phase, so understands Client 's expectations, wishes and requirements;\n3. Freeing up extra resources during the implementation / migration, so that we always have enough people to complete this process on time and properly;\n4. Thorough preparation, planning, control and implementation;\n5. ""Cooperate"" in advance as a flex worker in the departments, so that the onsite teams understand the operational activities and requirements at Client  well.In our opinion, a successful implementation / migration consists of 5 elements:\nWhat we expect from Client  is:\n- Good communication\n- Support and involvement on all levels\n- Insight in stakeholders\n?\n1. Care after the implementation face\nEven after the implementation phase, we will be more than usual on-site on location at fixed times, so that the flex workers can contact us with all their questions and we will handle this for Client . Personal contact is the key here. During the first few weeks, we regularly check per person whether everything is going well with the salary and whether everything is clear regarding the candidate portal and candidate file. We also put the implementation and migration, the first two months, on the agenda of the regular consultation moments with Client . In addition, flex workers can always call our CPA department, which is specially designed to answer first-line questions from flex workers. The back-office specialists know the ins and outs with regard to remuneration, legislation and regulations and the application of the hirer's remuneration at Client , so quickly remove any ambiguity.\n2. Customer expectations during implementation and migration\nThe starting point is that we unburden Client  during the implementation and migration as much as possible and that everything runs smoothly. Client  must be able to remain fully focused on the core activity, namely production and for the flex workers, only the logo above the salary slip must change and the rest remain the same and familiar.\nThe expectations in the form of actions can be found in the schedule under point 1. Gi Group also provides Client  with a complete package, including all documentation for the releasing party, information sheets, FAQ, presentations for the kick-off meetings and information sessions with flex workers, but also action and decision lists, etc. are ready to use. Thanks to our extensive experience with implementations and migrations of groups of tens to hundreds of flex workers, this is in good hands with Gi Group. That's a promise."
184,We would like to receive a proposal for an SLA for Client . Be specific and concise!,"The master vendor role that Gi Group takes up is central to the service. In addition to a total delivery responsibility, Gi Group can also be held accountable for the quality and performance of the delivered goods. The agreements made in the contract and the Service Level Agreement therefore relate to all flex workers supplied to Client  via Gi Group. How the collaboration between Gi Group and other agencies is organized is a responsibility of Gi Group (the master vendor) and will therefore not form part of this contract. The points listed below are a summary of the agreements between Gi Group and Client  in the field of service provision.\nThe aim of this SLA is to make binding agreements about the quality parameters of the service provision and about the reporting that should lead to an improvement in the quality of the service. The KPIs have been added to indicate the importance of a number of specific points within the whole of Gi Group's services.\n\n• Management information\nManagement information will be provided by Gi Group every 4 weeks at various levels. This information will be discussed during the 4-weekly and quarterly evaluation moments as included in the communication matrix.\n\n• Quality\nEvaluations are regularly carried out in accordance with the schedule to keep the quality (performance, reliability, competences) of the flex workers as high as possible and to continuously monitor and improve them. On average, the outcome of all evaluations must be at least “satisfactory” overall.\n\n• Phase management\nGi Group identifies the phase in which the flex worker is. This signaling is discussed once every 4 weeks in the operational consultation.\n\n• Accessibility Gi Group\nWe work with our Flexpool Coordinators in shifted shifts between 06:00 and 22:00 hours 7/7 and offer 1st line self-support as an IT solution between 22:00 and 06:00.\nThe self-support functionality, fulfills the replacement demand, by automatically sending a message to the reserve pool of candidates, allowing the available flex workers to schedule themselves to fill the shift. Thanks to this automated smart tooling, any other candidates who have also responded will be unsubscribed and the shift will be confirmed to the flex worker who has acted the fastest. The remuneration system rewards the most flexible flex workers. A lot is possible in the field of remuneration, but we are happy to coordinate this personally with Client .\nDuring the week, our Onsite Consultants normally work within office hours, so from 08:30 - 17:00, but if the client's duty roster makes it smarter to start the day structurally earlier, for example, we sometimes opt for shifted shifts.\nOutside the weekday working hours of the on-site operation, other solutions can also be devised to meet the replacement demand. An example of an alternative solution is:\nDaily up-to-date reserve pool in Mysolution with substitute workers, which is managed by a senior flex worker or a Client  team leader, who approaches the candidates by telephone. An advantage of this can be the personal contact and that you approach specific candidates first.\n\n• Information material\nGi Group will use or compile information material that is made available to flex workers who are placed at Client . Keeping this information material up-to-date lies with Client . Gi Group will always provide the latest version to the flex workers.\n\n• Safety\nGi Group will ensure that all flex workers are informed about and sign a statement that they are aware of the applicable health and safety rules within Client . Gi Group must also ensure a 100% comprehensive check on subjects such as work or residence permits (in the case of non-Dutch flex workers). Gi Group will ensure that all flex workers have the correct safety shoes (S3 = standard and is reimbursed by Gi Group). Other personal protective measures and clothing for flex workers will be purchased by Client ."
185,Which standard do you think you will set for the first 4 KPI's?,"Part of the management information is a set of fixed KPIs containing at least the following KPIs:\n• Services requested and provided (Delivery percentage, gross and net> 4 hours before start): 97%\n• (unwanted) turnover rate: 3%\n• Provision for ad-hoc questions (services requested on a daily basis"
186,We require a 24/7 availability in case of unexpected (replacement) demand. How are you going to organize this?,"Through our systems, which are all interconnected, we are able to provide 24/7 support to support.\nIn this process, Client  and flex workers are connected to each other by means of the portals that we make available to customers and flex workers. Communication between the portals is supported and by Mysolution, our HR software and coordinated by our planning system.\nIn order to achieve maximum results on replacement issues, our advice is to introduce a reward system in which the flex worker is the stakeholder in this.\nWe work in shifted shifts with our Flexpool Coordinators between 06:00 and 22:00 7/7 and offer 1st line self-support as an IT solution between 22:00 and 06:00.\n\nThe self-support functionality, fulfills the replacement demand, by automatically sending a message to the reserve pool of candidates, allowing the available flex workers to schedule themselves to fill the shift. Thanks to this automated smart tooling, any other candidates who have also responded will be unsubscribed and the shift will be confirmed to the flex worker who has acted the fastest. The remuneration system rewards the most flexible flex workers. A lot is possible in the field of remuneration, but we are happy to coordinate this personally with Client .\n\nDuring the week, our Onsite Consultants normally work within office hours, so from 08:30 - 17:00, but if the client's duty roster makes it smarter to start the day structurally earlier, for example, we sometimes opt for shifted shifts.\nOutside the weekday working hours of the on-site operation, other solutions can also be devised to meet the replacement demand. An example of an alternative solution is:\n\nDaily up-to-date reserve pool in Mysolution with substitute workers, which is managed by a senior flex worker or a Client  team leader, who approaches the candidates by telephone. An advantage of this can be the personal contact and also that you approach specific candidates first."
187,"If your organization has experience with a Master Vendor solution, can you describe it briefly?","Gi Group has a lot of experience in the Netherlands with similar constructions. We have both customers with large locations, where Gi Group has implemented a full Master Vendor, with a complete package of on-boarding, planning, pool management, time processing, billing and supplier management, as well as customers with small locations, for which we work together with the customer. have chosen the standard model.\n\nA full Master Vendor offers a more extensive service than that of a supplier and consists of five extra elements:\n\n1. Contract Management\n(Co-Vendors)\n2. Workforce Management (flex workers)\n3. Planning and pool management\n4. Time registration (one flow)\n5. Invoicing (one flow)\n\nAn SLA is drawn up that measures our process based on KPIs. These KPIs and our performance are always central during the consultation moments with Client . The Master Vendor, Gi Group takes care of the recruitment, planning, workforce management and communication to and from the Co-Vendor, so that Client  has a Single Point of Contact (SPOC) for all questions and services.\n\nClient  discusses together with the SPOC topics such as:\n• Requests\n• Forecast\n• Employer Branding\n• Occured problems \n\nA Master Vendor uses Co-Vendors for two specific reasons:\n• Quality; in cases where a specific demand requires a specialized supplier.\n• Quantity; When a volume request is so challenging at any given time, it takes multiple suppliers to meet it.\n\nOur most important ‘Lessons-Learned’ are:\n1. That the small locations often require more on-site presence than most broadcast partners offer with a small volume in hours;\n2. That the tightness on the labor market is forcing clients to switch to a model with a larger number of temporary employment partners. Each supplier uses a unique mix of channels and target groups, which increases the delivery guarantee for Client . Customization per location is important. In this way, clients reduce the risk of failure to deliver and of a decline in productivity due to a low quality of flex workers;\n3. That the percentage of EU flex workers in the pools is declining, because working conditions have improved significantly in Eastern Europe in particular. Looking at other source countries can be a solution (Gi Group also sources in Portugal and Spain, for example);\n4. That the basis, the process and the structure of the service model must be solid as a rock. Client  depends on the broadcast partners to serve its customers well, so there is no room for an unstable performance."
188,How do you feel about working with other parties? Do you think a supporting party needs a certain basic volume in order to function?,"Gi Group works in every role and in every construction, provided there are clear agreements, namely:\n• As a Single Supplier (standard model);\n• As a Co-Vendor together with other suppliers on the basis of equality (sometimes with a fixed share of hours and with a strong preference for direct account management);\n• As Master-Vendor with Co-Vendors who supply Gi Group;\n• As the only Co-Vendor where Gi Group supplies a Master Vendor."
189,"To what extent are you willing and able to handle the administrative processes around placement, planning, time processing and invoicing, via automated (linked) systems to expire (within the SETU standard)?","Our system Mysolution is the most advanced system for HR companies, especially in temping. All processes are centralized in one platform, so we can provide a full client- and candidate journey. We can connect almost every system with Mysolution.\nWe also work with Nedap's PEP software.

Our core profiles are; logistic worker, driver license-B, forklift driver, reachlift driver, production worker and operator."
195,Can you describe your ramp-up process in a new site? Please focus on timing and non-disruption for Client activities.,"At Gi Group, we have an international standard as it comes to implementing. In each country, we have a similar way of handling this process, adjusted to the local needs. We fully master the implementation and migration process, because we have done it numerous times. We have every detail written-out in detail in flow-charts, systematically. The main goal is that the temporary workers and Client are fully unburdened and facilitated by Gi Group, so that the implementation and migration goes flawless and without disturbances.\n\nNormally we need about 30-60 days to implement a new site. The exact timeline depends on four elements:\n1. Do we need to migrate the temporary workers from the incumbent supplier(s), towards Gi Group? If the answer is yes, how many temporary workers are we talking about?\n2. What is the number of temporary workers we need to recruit for Client, based on the rolling forecast?\n3. What is the level of complexity of the processes at the Client site, which we need to take into account?\n4. What is the level of complexity of the services (for example; testing, planning, pool management, on-boarding, vendor management etc.) that need to implement for Client?"
196,Could you describe your communication matrix?,"We will determine the definitive communication structure and agenda topics together with Client. Our mind-set is always proactive, sharp and focused on optimization and improvement. It starts with listening carefully, meeting expectations, follow-up actions points and mutual agreements. \nAll requests and questions are centralized through  the onsite consultant, the Single Point of Contact (SpoC), who dispatches the questions and follows up Client’s requests and questions which are managed on 3 different communication levels:\n\nOperational level (Onsite Operations)\nFrequency: daily / weekly\n• Operations\n• Forecast planning\n• Starts and stops temporary workers\n• Pool management\n• Recruitment campaigns\n• Issues\n\nTactical level ((Client Management – Account Team):\nFrequency: 6 times a year\n• KPIs and performance Gi Group\n• Mid-long term planning\n• Developments of the labour market\n• Process improvement\n• Escalations\n\nStrategic level (C-level)\nFrequency: 2 times a year\n• KPIs and performance Gi Group\n• Developments within Client\n• Developments within and from Gi Group\n• Developments of the labour market\n• Innovation proposals\n• Contract modifications"
197,Could you describe your customer satisfaction feedback mechanisms?,"We have the opinion that personal contact is key. We invest in our consultants and believe they should be able to make the difference for Client. Our main feedback channel is via them. Besides that on each level formal and informal moments are in place to get feedback from Client. And by the way, we give it too.  Finally we participate in the global and provide local customer satisfaction surveys."
198,Describe your strategies for retaining your temporary workforce,"Through our years of experience, we know exactly what the temporary worker expects from us as an employer. Based on this knowledge, an accompanying guidance process is been developed in which the temporary worker always is in the centre of attention:\n1. Guidance during the induction period;\n2. Contact moment at the end of the first working day and working week;\n3. Check on needs and motivation for training & schooling;\n4. Monitoring the progress and progress during training & schooling;\n5. Contact moment at the end of the probationary period;\n6. End of the first month probation interview;\n7. Structured evaluation moments (every quarter);\n8. Compliance with the Valeant evaluation methodology;\n9. Christmas gift and birthday card;\n10. Employees’ satisfaction survey."
199,Could you please describe your recruitment channels you common use?,"Some of the channels we common use are:\n\n• Social media – We invest heavily in paid social media marketing campaigns. The social channels that we use most at this point are; Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and LinkedIn.\n• Gi Group database – We have a unique candidate database that our Consultants work with on a daily basis. Our database offers advanced possibilities to reach groups of candidates that match a vacancy on an efficient way. It is possible to select CV’s by criteria such as place of residence, availability, work experience, education, salary request and keywords. Thanks to these advanced options, we can send targeted mailings to relevant candidates for Client vacancies. Of course we apply the new legislation regarding AWR and GDPR on our database.\n• www.gigroup.nl  – Through our website we reach a large number of unique visitors and applicants. Candidates find us via search engines; organic or, for example, through AdWords campaigns on Google. \n• Jobboards / Job crawlers – For the profiles of our clients, we place vacancies on national and regional job boards and job crawlers like Indeed and Neuvoo. We know exactly which job boards yield the best results for each target group.\n• Offline – Because the focus of most companies is online, we also use smart offline campaigns to recruit for our customers. Think about flyer actions, billboards or referral actions. By rewarding temps with an interesting amount of money for supplying new employees and by rewarding job-seekers with gift vouchers for supplying new employees, we are able to meet an extensive part of our recruitment needs.\n• Google for Jobs – Since 2019 the online job market is disrupted by internet giants. Companies, job boards and staffing agencies, for the time being can continue to occupy the top positions in Google with good Search Engine Optimization (SEO) or a large Google AdWords budget (SEA). However, with Google for Jobs the cards are shuffled again. Those who were too late for strong SEO and SEA now get new opportunities with Google for Jobs."
200,How could Gi Group improve the employer branding of the Client?,"Our marketing specialists and your Onsite Consultant are happy to think along with Client about employer branding. Nowadays, an employer branding strategy or no employer branding strategy makes the difference in a tight labor market, even now that more people are available due to the Corona pandemic. We see significant discrepancies in attracting and retaining talent between companies with a strong brand name, culture and large marketing budget and those that do not have this advantage."
201,Is there an escalation model available?,"Gi Group uses a communication matrix defined at the beginning of the collaboration. In addition, service reviews are held at least once a month. This is also used to check the KPIs and alignment to Service level Agreement. In the figure to the right, we have define the process, when dealing with and escalation. \n\nIn principle, all points of the escalation are processed in level 1 or 2. If there is no solution, the persons involved coordinate the integration of further necessary responsible persons.\nWe offer the Client directly a Senior Account Manager. TheSenior Account Manager is not in the operational line, but works from a helicopter view and acts from Gi Group Holding across the departments and brands. During the implementation phase, he or she will work closely with the Corporate Sales Manager, who takes the lead during the commercial process and therefore knows well what we have agreed and offered."
202,Describe how you approach the labor market in and around Franeker and how you search for candidates and eventually make them stay.,"HR-software    Gi Group uses the   Mysolution   software, an all-in-one solution, where the front, mid and back office are fully integrated in one system. The front and mid office use the   SalesForce   platform and the back office of Microsoft Navision, from which we also load all data via the   SalesForce   Einstein data warehouse into clear dashboards. This gives Gi Group the opportunity to analyze in detail all data that   is released   in the process from inflow, through flow to outflow, and make it available to Huhtamaki. By making the real-time data of the entire HR cycle accessible, we have insight into success factors, bottlenecks and performance. In the event of bottlenecks, we can (timely) adjust, optimize or intervene. In the case of success, we can continue, accelerate or broaden.        Targetgroup   dashboard     In   MySolution  , Gi Group has integrated the Intelligence Group target group dashboard, so that we have all the necessary information regarding supply analysis, labor market analysis and target group analysis. This gives Gi Group a detailed and realistic picture of the job market in the   Franeker   region and gives Huhtamaki an advantage over competing companies in the region looking for the same type of profiles. We can even map the current employment conditions of the companies in the region using public data that is accessible to us.    Some examples of data are:     Insight into recruitment feasibility: what percentage of your target group   is actively and / or latently looking  ? How scarce is your talent? How often are these accessed?      Insight into where and how you can reach your target group: through which media   channels   can I reach the active and latent target group? Which (pull) factors set him or her in motion? What are their hobbies and interests?      Insight into the (regional) labor market: what   is the average salary offered  ? Who are your competitors? How long are vacancies open on average?      The right target group information to manage realistic expectations towards Huhtamaki.     In Appendix   A   we give Huhtamaki a preview of the possibilities that this target group dashboard will offer us when we enter into a partnership with each other.    Search    Gi Group has a Central Recruitment Team (CRT). This is a centralized and specialized recruitment team of serious size, based in Amsterdam. Thanks to the CRT, we are able to scale up and down very quickly for our customers, because we can schedule recruiters in blocks of 3 hours for our customers throughout the Netherlands. The CRT is responsible for recruitment, pre-selection, reference checks, talent pool management and the scheduling of face-to-face conversations with our Onsite Consultants. The CRT has the latest IT applications and, in addition to the traditional telephone   line, also   makes extensive use of WhatsApp (messages / video), SMS, Facebook and FaceTime.    The CRT uses both online and offline channels. Online channels include social media such as; Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn,   but also   channels such as www.gigroup.nl, Google Adds and our own database. In addition, job boards are also used. These are digital boards on which vacancies and CVs   are published  , for example Indeed,   Neuvoo  ,   Nationale     Vacaturebank  , Werk.nl and regional platforms. Offline channels   are also actively used   in campaigns. There are many ways to search for suitable   candidates   offline for a vacancy. For example, flyers   are hung up and distributed around business parks, public buildings and supermarkets where Huhtamaki\'s competitors are located  . Vacancies   are also published   in local newspapers and referral campaigns are used (for example tell-a-friend promotions with a reward). When people get recommendations from people they trust, they are more likely to take the step.    Selection    After the pre-selection on hard criteria by the CRT, the   interviews are scheduled by the CRT   for the Onsite Consultant, who then makes the final match on soft criteria. The live interviews always take place on-site at Huhtamaki. The Onsite Consultant knows exactly what Huhtamaki is looking for, who fits the culture and values of Huhtamaki and knows not only the measurable competences, but also the softer characteristics that make an employee suitable for the vacancy. By conducting the interview in a structured way using smart interview techniques (for example STAR), we get a reliable picture of the behavior of an applicant in work situations. If large groups have to enroll at the same time, we sometimes choose to organize group sessions. We sometimes use assessments for more complex roles.    Bind    Labor is human work. By giving flex workers the right attention, turnover, absenteeism and no show   are reduced   and involvement is increased. By drawing up a retention plan, we ensure that the flex workers have a bond with Huhtamaki and Gi Group. Four needs are central to the retention plan; work,   pay,   attention and development.    After the right match, the guidance of the flex workers begins. Gi Group guides the flex workers placed at Huhtamaki in a human, yet structured way. The flex workers   are guided   because:     Gi Group wants to contribute to the labor market and develop and train flex workers based on this core value;    Gi Group is the official employer and attaches importance to satisfied flex workers;    A satisfied flex worker likes to go to work;    A satisfied flex worker performs better;    A satisfied flex worker is not very absent and stays longer at Huhtamaki.     The Gi Group Onsite Consultants are responsible for guiding flex workers. The Onsite Consultants are the experts in this field and   are supported   by our colleagues from the staff departments at the head office. Thanks to our many years of experience, we know exactly what our flex workers expect from us as an employer. Based on this knowledge, a coaching process   has been developed   in which the flex worker is central.    The retention plan for Huhtamaki can include:     Maintain as much contact as possible with the flex workers and know what is going on. This in a smart mix of as much on-site presence and contact over online channels as possible;    Streamlined onboarding; in which we offer clarity and structure in addition to a warm welcome;    Personal guidance during the induction period;    Contact moment at the end of the first working day and first working week;    Check for needs / motivation for a personal training program;    Monitoring progress during the training process;    Contact moment at the end of the trial period together with manager Huhtamaki;    End of the first month of probationary interview;    Structured evaluation moments (every quarter);    Compliance with Huhtamaki assessment system;    Show appreciation by means of Christmas gift, birthday card and reward for extra effort;    Structural employee satisfaction survey."
203,The process at Huhtamaki requires 24/7 availability in case of unexpected (replacement) demand. How are you going to organize this?,"Through our systems, which are all interconnected, we are able to provide 24/7 support to support.    In this process, Huhtamaki and flex workers   are connected   to each other by means of the portals that we make available to customers and flex workers. Communication between the portals is supported and by   Mysolution  , our HR software and coordinated by our planning system.    In order to achieve maximum results on replacement issues, our advice is to introduce a reward system in which the flex worker is the stakeholder in this.    We work in shifted shifts with our   Flexpool   Coordinators between 06:00 and 22:00 7/7 and offer   1st   line self-support as an IT solution between 22:00 and 06:00 (see figure 1).    The self-support   functionality,   fulfills the replacement demand, by automatically sending a message to the reserve pool of candidates, allowing the available flex workers to schedule themselves to fill the shift. Thanks to this automated smart tooling, any other candidates who have also responded will be unsubscribed and the shift   will be confirmed   to the flex worker who has acted the fastest. The remuneration system rewards the most flexible flex workers. A lot is possible in the field of remuneration, but we are happy to coordinate this personally with Huhtamaki.         ?       During the week, our Onsite Consultants normally work within office hours, so from 08:30 - 17:00, but if the client\'s duty roster makes it smarter to start the day structurally earlier, for example, we sometimes opt for shifted shifts.    Outside the weekday working hours of the on-site operation, other solutions   can also be devised   to meet the replacement demand. An example of an alternative solution is:      Daily up-to-date reserve pool in   Mysolution   with substitute workers, which   is managed   by a senior flex worker or a Huhtamaki team leader, who approaches the candidates by telephone. An advantage of this can be the personal contact   and also   that you approach specific candidates first."
204,"Which standard do you think you will set for the first 4 KPIs, which other KPIs would you like to add and how will you report these?","Part of the management information is a set of fixed KPIs containing at least the following KPIs:     Services requested and provided (Delivery percentage, gross and net> 4 hours before start).    (  unwanted  ) turnover percentage.    Provision for ad hoc questions (requested services on a daily basis     KPIs on correct time processing and invoicing.    Average hourly rate development.     Standardization of the first   4   KPIs Huhtamaki:     Services requested and provided (Delivery percentage, gross and net> 4 hours before start): 97%    (unwanted) turnover rate: 3%    Provision for ad-hoc questions (services requested on a daily basis     KPIs on correct time processing and invoicing: 99% accuracy (if hours are delivered digitized)    Development of the average hourly rate: In view of the increasing reduction in youth wages, we expect to achieve little savings with the target group of young people. We   can, however, actively deploy   the use of holiday workers and those entitled to AOW, for which a more competitive cost price applies.   Andere   kpi’s   die Gi Group voorstelt: Ziekteverzuim: 4%, No shows eerste werkdag: 1%              We share our KPIs through a report that we can generate at any time from   Mysolution   our HR software with real-time information, available in handy dashboards. These reports   are shared   with Huhtamaki on a monthly basis before the start of operational meetings. We calculate all KPIs on the average of a period of one year."
205,We would like to receive a proposal for an SLA for Huhtamaki. Be specific and concise! Can you confirm that this proposal has been sent to j.voerman@tisg.nl?,"Proposal Service Level Agreement for cooperation between Huhtamaki and Gi Group    The master vendor role that Gi Group takes up is central to the service. In addition to a total delivery responsibility, Gi Group   can also be held   accountable for the quality and performance of the delivered goods. The agreements made in the contract and the Service Level Agreement therefore relate to all flex workers supplied to Huhtamaki via Gi Group.   How the collaboration between Gi Group and other agencies is organized is a responsibility of Gi Group (the master vendor) and will therefore not form part of this contract.   The points listed below are a summary of the agreements between Gi Group and Huhtamaki in the field of service provision.    The aim of this SLA is to make binding agreements about the quality parameters of the service provision and about the reporting that should lead to an improvement in the quality of the service.    The KPIs   have been added   to indicate the importance of a number of specific points within the whole of Gi Group\'s services.    Management information    Management information will be provided by Gi Group   every 4 weeks at various levels. This information   will be discussed   during the 4-weekly and quarterly evaluation moments as included in the communication matrix (see Appendix B: communication matrix)    Quality    Evaluations are regularly carried out in accordance with the schedule to keep the quality (performance, reliability,   competences  ) of the flex workers as high as possible and to continuously monitor and improve them. On average, the outcome of all evaluations must be at least “satisfactory” overall.    Phase management    Gi Group identifies the phase in which the flex worker is. This signaling   is discussed   once every 4 weeks in the operational consultation.    Accessibility Gi Group    We work with our   Flexpool   Coordinators in shifted shifts between 06:00 and 22:00 hours 7/7 and offer 1st line self-support as an IT solution between 22:00 and 06:00.

An example of an alternative solution is:    Daily up-to-date reserve pool in   Mysolution   with substitute workers, which   is managed   by a senior flex worker or a Huhtamaki team leader, who approaches the candidates by telephone. An advantage of this can be the personal contact and that you approach specific candidates first.    Information material    Gi Group will use or compile information material that is made available to flex workers who are placed at Huhtamaki. Keeping this information material up-to-date lies with Huhtamaki. Gi Group will always provide the latest version to the flex workers.    Safety    Gi Group will ensure that all flex workers   are informed   about and sign a statement that they are aware of the applicable health and safety rules within Huhtamaki. Gi Group must also ensure a 100% comprehensive check on subjects such as work or residence permits (in the case of non-Dutch flex workers). Gi Group will ensure that all flex workers have the correct safety shoes (S3 = standard and is reimbursed by Gi Group).   Other personal protective measures and clothing for flex workers will be purchased by Huhtamaki  ."
206,"Work out a concise action plan for the implementation period, including a migration plan, with at least the following content:","A planning including a well-developed communication and migration plan, including concrete detailed steps, milestones and a critical path, in which it is clear that the (activities for the) implementation will be ready within 8 weeks.    The composition of a dedicated project team, including one central contact person;    A description of the manner of aftercare after the implementation phase;    A description of what   is expected   of the customer during this period.     In our opinion, a successful implementation / migration consists of   5   elements:    1. A qualitative implementation team, composed of experienced professionals (at all levels), who have already completed many migrations  ;    2. A migration team that is already involved during the RFP phase, so understands Huhtamaki\'s expectations, wishes and requirements;    3.   Freeing   up extra resources during the implementation / migration, so that we always have enough people to complete this process on time and properly;    4. Thorough preparation, planning, control and implementation;    5. ""Cooperate"" in advance as a flex worker in the departments, so that the onsite teams understand the operational activities and requirements at Huhtamaki   well.      In   our opinion, a successful implementation / migration consists of   5   elements:    What we expect from Huhtamaki is:     Good communication    Support and involvement on all levels    Insight in stakeholders      ?        Care after the implementation face     Even after the implementation phase, we will be more than usual on-site on location at fixed times, so that the flex workers can contact us with all their questions and we will handle this for Huhtamaki. Personal contact is the key here. During the first few weeks, we regularly check per person whether everything is going well with the salary and whether everything is clear regarding the candidate portal and candidate file. We also put the implementation and migration, the first two months, on the agenda of the regular consultation moments with Huhtamaki. In addition, flex workers can always call our CPA department, which   is specially designed   to answer first-line questions from flex workers. The back-office specialists know the ins and outs with regard to remuneration, legislation and regulations and the application of the hirer\'s remuneration at Huhtamaki, so quickly remove any ambiguity.    2. Customer expectations during implementation and migration    The starting point is that we unburden Huhtamaki during the implementation and migration as much as possible and that everything runs smoothly. Huhtamaki must be able to remain fully focused on the core activity, namely production and for the flex workers, only the logo above the salary slip must change and the rest remain the same and familiar.    The expectations in the form of actions   can be found   in the schedule under point 1. Gi Group also provides Huhtamaki with a complete package, including all documentation for the releasing party, information sheets, FAQ, presentations for the kick-off meetings and information sessions with flex workers, but also action and decision lists, etc. are ready to use. Thanks to our extensive experience with implementations and migrations of groups of tens to hundreds of flex workers, this is   in good hands   with Gi Group.   That\'s   a promise.   ?"
207,"Huhtamaki is considering outsourcing the planning of permanent staff to the chosen partner (in the near future). Sketch the working method, conditions and indicate how, for example, team leaders can also work in this. Please provide examples from comparable customers.","See the answers to questions 12, 13 and 22. We can easily add the planning of permanent staff to this, but there are additional costs involved.    As an example, we would like to name our customer   Simei   in   Lelystad  ,   Inditex\'s   ironing center."
208,"How do you specifically plan to build up the flex pool (students) and the holiday pool? And how do you keep in touch with this target group ""from day to day"" during calls, changes, etc.?","Recruitment    This target group of students requires a different approach than we use for regular vacancies. For this target group we make more use of social media channels such as Instagram, Snapchat,   Tiktok  ,   etc.Possibilities   for offline campaigns (such as at MBO / HBO schools, universities, sports associations or other channels) are also included.    From reports displayed by our recruitment software, we can immediately measure and manage the success factors during each campaign.    Keeping contact     Keep in touch with the pool by telephone, WhatsApp, SMS or other popular channels through a fixed schedule.   And   send automated, but personalized messages at important moments such as birthdays, graduation, new year transition. The aim is to maintain the pool.    Reward system     The options for retaining this target group can also include a reward system that   can be saved   for something per hour worked. This will certainly ensure maintenance of the pool in the summer period."
209,"Huhtamaki has a fairly flat hiring pattern with peaks for Easter, Christmas and during the holiday period. How can you guarantee that as many of the same, well-worked-in forces are used again?","The basis of qualitative pool management is good and frequent communication with the candidates in the pool. The communication is a mix of personal contact through channels, such as; telephone, email, WhatsApp, SMS and social media and automated messages via   SalesForce     Pardot  , our marketing automation tool, which is fully integrated into our HR software   Mysolution  . If you give enough attention to the candidates in the pool, the pool will remain more filled and up to date. Both the Central Recruitment Team and the Onsite Consultants have a role in pool management. Below we describe three solutions to bind well-developed forces so that they   can be used   again at a later stage.    Shield model         By using a shell model, in which we apply   4   layers in the pool, we can better categorize and retain flex workers. Not everyone wants to work as many hours a week as possible.     Permanent employees of Huhtamaki;      (Almost) full-time flex workers; create volume in the workforce; also   by not always deploying   everyone full-time, so that a surplus in the pool becomes available. This keeps the quality and stability high;      Part-time flex workers  ;   for peaks in the week and weekends.      Holiday forces / peak forces; flex workers only used to absorb peak times and holidays. In addition to students, you can also think of part-time parents or state pensioners.   ?       Reservation of over hours     What we also use for our customers is to encourage the flex workers in layer D to work overtime, so that after the peak, we pay these hours in phases in order to keep this group of flex workers longer with Huhtamaki.    A third solution is the use of pool sharing, whereby the flex workers   are also deployed   at other Gi Group customers. For flex workers living independently in the Netherlands, we combine working at Huhtamaki with work within a maximum travel time of 45 minutes, but for migrant workers, for whom we also provide housing, transport, insurance, etc., this is possible with our customers throughout the Netherlands. . If we also deploy labor migrants at Huhtamaki, Gi Group can have the machine instructions translated into English, so that we can also deploy English-speaking flex workers during peak times."
210,With what planning system do you operate and is the opportunity there fort he customer to make use of that system (in the future)?,"Planning system    We work with our own planning system, integrated in the cloud solution of   Mysolution  , which forms the heart of our digital front, mid and back office. This is the best HR software on the market for HR service providers. The team leaders in production also get their own login to the planning system, to make real-time adjustments and always see what is happening in the planning (see the answers to questions 12 and 22 for more information about the planning system  . )  .        Clock system   ?   ?  We   also propose the clock system to implement   Nedap\'s   PEP Flex.    Flex workers clock in and out with their    ?  personal PEP card at a PEP Reader.          PEP registers the clocked hours of the flex workers. The hours   are approved   by those responsible and then go to the salary package in   Mysolution   and Gi Group that can process the hours for invoicing.         ?  The PEP system also keeps track of the contract hours and leave balances. This is always clear to those involved.    Clocking in on the PEP Readers can   be done   upon arrival, but can also be done by cost plate, line or activity, for example. The readers are equipped with a battery and make contact with one PEP gateway that collects all information and sends it to the PEP software. The collection and forwarding   is done   via the GPRS network by means of a SIM card that is built into the gateway. This will give you a wealth of information about how much and how long work has been carried out to cost center / activity level.   ?   ?    In addition, the manager has the option to view all hours worked in the current and previous weeks of the employee. The hours and entitlements accrued are also transparent. Both the accrued hours / rights and hours worked and allowances are transparent to the employee. It is possible for the manager to make a total overview of the hours worked and to export this. PEP Flex   is already linked   to   Mysolution  , so that we can digitally enter the hours via an interface. This reduces the error margins and we can see in real time who   is clocked   in, which makes attendance checks a lot easier. Running reports is   aslo   easy.     The costs for the implementation and use of PEP Flex are already included in our pricing."
211,Describe in a short process flow what your process of planning and pool management will look like in the context of Huhtamaki\'s desired planning methodology described in the introduction (planning for availability and competences across departments and teams).,"The success factors for making and executing the planning and pool management are always communication and the planning tool, both towards each other, and towards the internal organization and flex workers. Because we still have insufficient knowledge of the planning processes at Huhtamaki at this stage, other than what   is described   in the RFP documentation, it is difficult to create a process flow. We have therefore based the process flow below   on the basis of   our knowledge and experiences with similar production customers.     1 week before planning, a proposal planning is made by Gi Group based on the forecast from Huhtamaki;    When the proposal schedule is ready, it is available to the team leaders within 48 hours. The team leaders have access via their own login to our planning system to make real-time adjustments;    The team leaders have access 5 days before the planning starts. 2 days before the planning starts, they must have entered the changes (think of dividing services, competencies and positions according to their own wishes)    We send out planning 2 days in advance for two weeks later;    The team leaders can always monitor in real-time what is happening in the planning, so when we make a proposal for a change, the team leaders are also watching. We all see one schedule;    We distinguish two phases in our planning system, namely proposal planning and actual planning;    After changes, we consult with the team leaders and these changes   can be refuted   within 24 hours. In short, we always keep in touch with the team leaders;    Per department, we schedule a short operational meeting with the team leaders once a week to discuss the changes;    The flex workers receive an email or text message with the services (in coordination with Huhtamaki);    Pool management is organized on the basis of functions and availability;    Planning is organized   on the basis of   departments, teams, positions and competences.     The   Mysolution   planning tool takes into account the applicable collective labor agreement, the Working Hours Act and other laws and regulations. Within the frameworks set by Huhtamaki, employees have the option of self-rostering via PC, tablet and smartphone, with the 24/7 app, in the event of ad hoc changes. If something changes in one timetable, the other timetables will automatically adjust accordingly. Gi Group advises Huhtamaki on planning and pool management on matters such as:     Where are the bottlenecks?      Where and when is cross training / education necessary?      When should recruitment start in order to anticipate peaks in time?      How can we improve forecasting together? (based on history)      What is the optimal pile composition and size?      Which mix of target groups works best per profile and / or department?"
212,How do you propose to organize this at the start of the implementation?,"With a volume of 60,000 hours per year, converted 1,150 per week, Gi Group guarantees an in-house occupation of at least 2 days per week. Due to the flexibility in our model, we can easily adapt our in-house presence to the needs during peak times, during implementation and migration and during final selection interview rounds.    Thanks to our onsite model with mobile consultants, who are supported and unburdened by the CRT, CPA the   Flexpool   Coordinators and our Staff departments, we are generally   more present   in-house than our competitors with a volume of 60,000 hours per year. The presence and occupation of the in-house office partly depends on the number of flex hours per week. If the number of hours falls below the number agreed in writing (60,000 hours / year), Gi Group reserves the right to adjust the daily staffing accordingly.    We will involve Huhtamaki in the process of selecting a suitable in-house employee."
213,"Given the information in the introduction and your own knowledge of Huhtamaki; is the ""traditional"" in-house role necessary in your view? If not, how do you organize the necessary attention, if so how would you implement the in-house role? Which tasks, roles, activities contribute most to Huhtamaki\'s goals?","In our opinion, the onsite model is the only way   to properly implement   the HR partnership that   Huhthamaki   aspires to. Gi Group therefore does not have a branch network and is always onsite with its customers, whereby the onsite presence   is linked   to the hours per week (see question 11). The close interdependence between the two organizations in the deployment of a large group of flex workers on the basis of posting in a so-called triangular employment relationship, combined with the requirements and wishes with regard to service provision from Huhtamaki, means that regular but efficient communication is the only key to success. The Corona pandemic has taught the world to adapt to more remote communication through channels like; Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Skype for Business, etc. What has also become clear is that personal physical contact on the work floor is indispensable to strengthen a relationship and to arrive at creative solutions together.    However, these activities   can easily be done   from a distance, such as:     Search    Pre-selection    Assessments    Marketing    Administration     Report    Planning and pool management    Replace no shows    Master Vendor service    Show up checks      Activities, where onsite presence is required, are      Implementation and migration    Final selection rounds    Introduction (onboarding, instructions)    Tours     Company equipment; safety shoes, uniforms, PBM, access cards, etc.    Schooling     Show up checks     Evaluations and assessments      Work meetings (weekly, monthly, quarterly  )    We   can also perform the above activities that are mentioned in the case of physical on-site presence, remotely. However, we strongly prefer to carry out these activities on-site with a physical presence."
214,"By accepting the role of Master Vendor, your organization declares that it indemnifies the customer from any liability towards sub-suppliers deployed by your organization (as Master Vendor). Do you agree with this?","Yes, Gi Group is responsible for managing the sub-suppliers.    In concrete terms, this means that we apply the same rates and conditions to the sub-suppliers, as agreed between Huhtamaki and Gi Group. Gi Group will also take care of all communication towards the sub-suppliers, about operational matters such as  ;   vacancies, onboarding and planning, so that Huhtamaki only has one single point of contact, namely the Gi Group Onsite Consultant."
215,"Huhtamaki requests a Master Vendor (brokerage) role from her partner. If you cannot foresee yourself, engage other agencies that meet all the conditions set in the job profiles and against the agreed (financial) conditions. Do you agree with this? Do you already have (potential) partners in the region, if so which ones?","Yes, we agree with this.    Yes, we have both local partners and nationally operating partners. In the   answer   we primarily focus on our technical partners, as we expect to mainly need support from our partner database in the field of the heavier profiles, such as TD and experienced Operator.    A selection of our technical partners:     Xelvin      Jobz  -on      IJssel Technology      Techsharks      AB Vakwerk     Our colleague Joost Vinkenvleugel, Business Unit Director Grafton, has a particularly extensive network in the technical niche market and will play a supporting role in the background.   Esther de Haan, Gi Group Operations Manager, also knows the Frisian market well, as she was born and raised in Friesland."
216,"""A good start is half the work"". The better a new employee is informed, the lower the unwanted outflow and the higher the productivity. In what way and with what means do you guarantee optimal ""onboarding"" of new employees and what can this all include?","Everything depends on the timely availability, maintenance and registration of the most up-to-date and correct information in one system. In this Gi Group has a “fetch duty” and Huhtamaki a “fetch duty”.    Sales    In our opinion, the design of the onboarding already starts with the start-up of a new customer. Sales has answered the questions from the customer during the commercial process and, together with operations, devised the solution in the form of related services. The agreements   are laid down   in an SLA and this is offset by a tariff. This information   is entered   by sales in   Mysolution  , our HR software, where the entire cycle of processes from inflow,   throughflow   to outflow and invoicing come together. Sales always remains closely involved during the implementation phase and works together with operations. Sales organizes a handover meeting, where all information is shared and discussed with colleagues from all departments such as; operation, recruitment, planning, finance and administration.    Recruitment    Recruitment also plays an important role in informing flex workers, because recruitment establishes the first contacts with the prospective flex workers for Huhtamaki. The recruiters must therefore be well informed about all the   ins   & outs at Huhtamaki and maintain short lines of communication with the Onsite Consultants.    CPA    The administrative process   is completely taken   over by the Onsite Consultant by our CPA department, so that the Onsite Consultant can focus on account management and workforce management. CPA has no contact with the customer, but only with the flex workers. CPA takes care of all administrative matters concerning flex workers (hirer\'s remuneration, contracting, time processing, wage payments, corrections, leave, illness, etc.) and maintains the   1st   line of communication with the flex workers. As a result, we deploy specialists in the administrative process, which reduces the error margins and the flex workers have quick answers to their questions. Before CPA can send a flex worker his or her employment contract for the digital signature,   all mandatory   and signed documents must be uploaded from the placement in the system and CPA must follow all instructions that we have specified specifically for Huhtamaki in   Mysolution   our HR -software. Think of things like; deposit forms, collective labor agreement, safety instructions, non-disclosure agreement, explanation, planning, time registration and company assets, such as shoes and clothing. We make a working-by-booklet especially for Huhtamaki, in which the most important things   are clearly described  . The Onsite Consultant goes through this work-by-booklet extensively with the flex worker. These documents and instructions are easy to find for flex workers at any time via the online candidate portal, which is also accessible via an app. The safeguarding of all these process steps in   Mysolution   contributes to a positive experience for the flex worker of the onboarding.    Onsite operation    In our opinion, nothing beats personal contact, so our Onsite Consultants are often on-site during the onboarding and induction period to inform, guide and answer questions for the flex workers. In   this   we always look for the triangle with production and HR of Huhtamaki, because only together we can optimally fulfill this period of information and instruction.   ?"
217,"What posseblities and experience do you have with the training of forklift drivers and operators, what is the pricing and what part will you take for your own expense?","The costs for lift, reach or narrow aisle truck training are fully covered by Gi Group from the budget of the 1.02% training reservation that we build up for flex workers in phase A (78 weeks). We train a large part of our logistics temporary workers through BLOM training courses. At the request of our client, this   can of course also be done   via another training institute in the   Franeker   region.    Together with Huhtamaki, we can select temporary workers and annually offer a group of excellence (as a guideline the aforementioned evaluations) training, for example Operator MBO 3. In doing so, they become more specialist and Huhtamaki can offer them career opportunities, thereby increasing the chance of retaining   these excellence   by Huhtamaki.    An example of a training that we regularly purchase for our customers in the production sector is  :     https://www.opleiding.nl/opleiding/mbo-vakopleiding-procesverbetering.html?open=brochure-lite&course=a9f3a7ac-78ba-4c8a-819e-42658a9b0f73            This training is at MBO-3 level, but shortened to the essential courses that are required for process operators and the costs are approximately € 2,630. A full MBO-3 training for process operator costs € 6,685. For the latter   training   it is a requirement that Huhtamaki is a recognized training company. We are happy to coordinate with Huhtamaki the exact percentage that Gi Group takes care of for this type of training, because this depends on how the total training budget is spent and for   this   we must first properly map out the volumes and wishes."
218,"How do you think you can spend the 1.02% reservation for training at Huhtamaki? In addition, are there currently interesting subsidy options for Huhtamaki related to the use of (flexible) labor? If so, which ones and how can these be used in practice?","Schooling reservation    Training is a very important ingredient to bind and captivate flex workers. Specialized technical knowledge is a great addition to the production at Huhtamaki. We propose to select flex workers together with Huhtamaki and to annually offer a group of outstanding people (as a guideline the aforementioned evaluations) a training course, for example Operator MBO 3, or another training that meets   Huhtamaki\'s   training needs. In doing so, the flex workers become more specialists, all-rounder deployable in the pool and Huhtamaki can offer them career opportunities, increasing the chance of Huhtamaki retaining these stars.    Another group we can offer language training, safe working training, forklift or manager training. This is in consultation with Huhtamaki to give shape, whereby the outcome of the evaluations of the temporary workers also indicate a direction.    Subsidies     We propose to distribute the following subsidies, which   are paid out   and apply to the population of flex workers who work at Huhtamaki 50/50 through Gi Group. Huhtamaki will then receive the 50% part of the subsidy after it   has been paid   to Gi Group.

Stimulating and promoting sustainable employability involves career, learning, development, health and finances. DOORZAAM distributes training vouchers to temporary employment organizations as a financial support for flex workers. The flex worker can use the voucher to choose one or more training courses, courses or training courses up to a maximum of € 500 incl. VAT. Upon receipt of these training vouchers, Gi Group will also make them available to flex workers deployed at Huhtamaki.    DOORZAAM:    https://www.doorzaam.nl/loopbaan/scholingsvouchers/   ."
219,"With what methods do you quarantee the quality and functioning of the temp workers, measure and report this?","Recruitment     During the recruitment of flex workers, various steps have been built in to check the quality of the temporary worker in advance:    Telephone screening (availability, willingness to work shifts, motivation, certificates, language, etc.);    Reference check;    Face2face intake at location Huhtamaki by Onsite Consultant (deeper into competencies, shifts, motivation, culture match, general impression);    Conduct (language) tests or assessments for senior and office   positions.

Interim   assesment       Interim assessment is always in consultation with the customer, as an assessment system has often already been set up. Gi Group\'s standard procedure is as follows:     Evaluation first day (by telephone by Onsite Consultant)    Evaluation first week (by phone by Onsite Consultant)    Evaluation first month (preferably on site by Onsite Consultant, if desired with the manager of the flex worker)    Evaluation after six months (on location by Onsite Consultant, preferably together with the   flexworker\'s   manager)    Annual evaluation (on location by Onsite Consultant, preferably together with the   flexworker\'s   manager)     All assessments and communication   are recorded   in   Mysolution  , Gi Group\'s HR system.    Ongoing processes    In addition to the formal evaluations, the Gi Group Onsite Consultant also regularly has an informal conversation with the managers and flex workers, so that any pain points   are quickly identified  . Our goal is to be on site as much as possible, especially during shift changes, so that we hit the people.    Training     Together with Huhtamaki, we draw up a training plan per profile per person, whereby we will fully utilize the training reservation of 1.02% of the gross salary in phase A.    Reports    In line with the agreed consultation structure (see Appendix B: communication matrix), a report will be published in which the assessments are communicated. These reports also include details such as absenteeism, not showing up, arriving late, etc. We would like to talk to Huhtamaki about the requirements and wishes regarding this report."
220,Which clients with a comparable need do you have within a radius of 25 km around the location (Franeker) of Huhtamaki?,"Our closest customer is Bakker   Logistiek  , with branches in   Heerenveen   and   Zeewolde  , among others.    We also serve many customers in Flevoland (including   Lelystad  , Almere) and Groningen (including   Farmsum  ,   Veendam  ,   Kolham  ).    It does not matter to Gi Group at which location in the Netherlands a company is located, as long as we can grow (quickly) to a volume of at least 1,000 hours per week. In the past 4   years   we have grown so quickly to more +50 onsite locations, spread throughout the Netherlands, including on-sites in very remote areas.

221,What contribution could you have to the employer branding of Huhtamaki?,"Our marketing specialists and your Onsite Consultant are happy to think along with Huhtamaki about employer branding. Nowadays, an employer branding strategy or no employer branding strategy makes the difference in a tight labor market, even now that more people are available due to the Corona pandemic. We see significant discrepancies in attracting and retaining talent between companies with a strong brand name, culture and large marketing budget and those that do not have this advantage.    Together with   Huhtamaki   we make a SWOT analysis, in which the key points related to; “Why candidates would like to work at Huhtamaki” has been incorporated. We compare this SWOT analysis with a (local) competition analysis, after which we determine together which of the strengths we use in labor market communication, such as recruiting and SEO proof vacancy texts with an attractive layout, but also custom advertisements that we use via online - and offline channels (see question 1). We also determine together with   Huhtamaki which   channel mix we will use. To arrive at a channel mix, we do AB tests, in which we try multiple channels and variants of advertisements, so that we can measure what gives the best results in the   Franeker   region. We always keep costs vs. the expected result sharp in the eye. Because we can analyze all data in   Mysolution  , our HR software, handy dashboards allow us to see which campaigns are most successful. After we have determined the employer branding strategy together with Huhtamaki, we make an action plan and a schedule. Employer branding is a fixed item on the agenda below during our meetings (see Appendix B: communication matrix).    From our vision, employer branding can only be achieved if the internal organization supports this image and there is commitment at all levels; before and during the execution, both on the side of Huhtamaki, and on the side of Gi Group. Communication of texts, images and videos are especially important during the recruitment and selection phase.   But   what was communicated during recruitment and selection must become apparent in reality during the introduction, the induction process, development and in the working environment at Huhtamaki. External communication is about what, but especially how you communicate. The content must be consistent, honest and in line with the culture, target audience and predetermined message. In addition, the form also determines   to a large extent   how the message comes across.   Who\'s   speaking?   What\'s   the tone? How does it look? For example, do you want to position yourself as a young, innovative organization with a focus on fun? Then the communication must radiate this. Is development one of your spearheads? Then make sure that this is reflected   again and again   in your communication.    In addition, it is important to understand the candidates, so that together we can make Huhtamaki more interesting for them. Part of understanding the candidate   is understanding   where their interests lie. In addition, it is essential to look at where this specific group of   candidates can be found, so on which platform. With this information, suitable vacancies   can be written   on the right platforms.    Another possibility that Gi Group hopes to put into practice in the future at Huhtamaki is to make videos about the temporary workers who will start working at Huhtamaki. This gives an idea of ??what a working day at Huhtamaki looks like. Interviews   can also be held   with the temporary workers, in which they can tell about their work experience and perception.    Finally, we will look together at a content strategy and we can advise Huhtamaki on how smart more attention   can be paid   to increasing brand awareness on social media. Ultimately, we can only be successful in employer branding and marketing if our team can work closely with the team within Huhtamaki who is responsible for this."

224,"Indicate what interest Smurfit Kappa will have in you as a customer? Indicate which position, based on the indicative turnover, Smurfit Kappa will have with you as a customer.","In all stands, Smurfit Kappa will be treated by Gi Group as an XL key account, and Smurfit Kappa is of great strategic importance to Gi Group. This means that we will do everything we can to keep flex workers happy and Smurfit Kappa as a customer happy.\n\nIn addition to the Onsite Consultants and the national Operations Manager, the Smurfit Kappa Account Team will also include the Recruitment Manager, Sales Director and Country Manager. The XL key accounts are a fixed part of the weekly agenda of the entire MT, in which all departments are represented, namely; Operations, Recruitment, Marketing, Sales, Finance and HR.\n\nOn the indicative turnover from the tender document, Smurfit Kappa will take the 6th customer position at Gi Group."
225,What activities do you have with Smurfit Kappa outside The Netherlands?,"Anno 2019 Gi Group is a supplier of Smurfit Kappa in the UK and Portugal. Gi Group was also one of the major preferred suppliers of Smurfit Kappa in Italy until the beginning of 2016. The turnover in Italy at the time was approximately € 2,000,000. In Spain we also maintain contacts with Smurfit Kappa with Mr. Eduardo Monteiro."
226,"It is customary to divide the labor market into three segments, namely the bottom, middle segment and top of the labor market. The level of education is usually used as the benchmark for this distribution. The lower end of the labor market consists of jobs that do not require a basic qualification. It therefore concerns jobs for which an elementary level or a VMBO or MBO-1 level is required. The middle segment consists of jobs for which MBO 2 to 4 level is required and at the top of the labor market these are jobs for which HBO or university is required. Indicate which segment of the labor market you serve and with what percentage?","The Gi Group brand in the Netherlands mainly supplies flex workers in the production and logistics sectors. Within these sectors we focus on the following profiles:\n• Logistics worker \n• Reachtruck chauffeur\n• Chauffeur with a driverslicense B \n• Production worker \n• Operator\n• Administrative employee\n• Receptionist\n• Data-entry employee \nThe above profiles, which we largely fill in through the supply of flex workers, are a mix of VMBO or MBO-1 level and MBO 2 to 4 level.\n\nThe Grafton brand in the Netherlands provides the services; Recruitment & Selection, Secondment and ZZP brokering. Grafton consists of the divisions:\n• Logistics & Supply Chain\n• Office & HR\n• Finance & Accounting \nGrafton focuses on candidates from MBO 2 to 4 level up to HBO and University level. We also have a division under our own brand within Grafton, namely; Fashion & Luxury.\n\nGi Group accounts for approximately 86% of our annual turnover and Grafton for the remaining 14%. This is mainly because Grafton largely works on the basis of Recruitment & Selection."
227,How do you see / assess the labor market and its influence on Smurfit Kappa? Can you explain how you can support us in this.,"Due to the sustained growth of the Dutch economy, resulting in a historically low unemployment rate of 3.9% (August 2018), there is a major shortage of suitable personnel across all sectors and at all levels. This means that companies like Smurfit Kappa will have to distinguish themselves from the competition, who are looking for similar profiles in order to attract and retain the talented employees.\n\nThe “WHY” of a company now determines the “DNA” of the company and this translates into a proposition and the final product. Nowadays it is no longer just about the remuneration, this must of course be in line with the market, but about the total experience at a company. So also consider matters such as work environment, atmosphere, development of the employees, collecting and using ideas, involving employees, events such as; get-togethers, corporate parties, birthdays and seminars are crucial. This also demands something from the leadership of the board and management.\n\n“Practice what you preach!”, So Gi Group is at the forefront in this area. We advise our clients on employer branding and recruitment strategy. We really see recruitment as customization per profile, location and region. Together with the local operation and HR, we determine the best mix of recruitment channels and the ratio of online and offline marketing. The competition and SWOT analysis gives us more insight. Gi Group is extremely data-driven, we measure absolutely everything. Through AB testing and data analysis, we know which channel mix works best per profile and per region. We also combine this with smart original offline campaigns, in which we use referral and modern applications, such as Whatsapp and QR codes, hand in hand. We are happy to tell Smurfit Kappa more during the presentation rounds."
228,What options do you have to promote Smurfit Kappa as a top local employer (Employer Branding).,"We like to think along with Smurfit Kappa about employer branding. Nowadays, whether or not an employer branding strategy makes the difference in the tight labor market. We see significant discrepancies in attracting and retaining talent between companies with a strong brand and culture and those that do not have this advantage.\n\nTogether with Smurfit Kappa we make a SWOT analysis, in which the key points related to; “Why candidates would like to work at Smurfit Kappa” has been incorporated.

We always keep costs vs. the expected result sharp in the eye. After we have determined the strategy together with Smurfit Kappa, we make an action plan and a schedule. During our consultation moments, employer branding is a fixed item on the agenda below\n\nIn addition to advising Smurfit Kappa on employer branding, Gi Group itself also invests in increasing its brand awareness through social media campaigns via channels such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Jobboards, Jobcrawlers, as well as through our sponsorships with Scuderia Toro Rosso. F1, AC Milan and FC Wolfsburg, volleyball team Monza where we are the “Official HR Partner”."
229,"How do you see the collaboration model with Smurfit Kappa. For example, do you employ a second party as a subcontractor, or are you willing to work with other agencies that are complementary?","Gi Group uses sub suppliers for two specific reasons:\n• Quality; in cases where a specific question (profile) requires a specialized supplier.\n• Quantity; When a volume request is so challenging at any given time, it takes multiple suppliers to meet it.\nGi Group works with a trusted selection of sub suppliers for both quality and quantity issues.\n\nGi Group focuses on flex workers living independently in the Netherlands. If Smurfit Kappa prefers to work at certain locations with flex workers residing outside the Netherlands, Gi Group can deploy its regular sub-supplier in this area, or work with the current supplier (s) of Smurfit Kappa."
230,Is it important to have a minimum turnover level in order to maintain a certain service level? And if 'Yes' what is the minimum level?,"From the Gi Group service model, we always work from the customer location. Thanks to this Onsite model, we are able to be more present at Smurfit Kappa at locations with small volumes than our competitors. From a volume of 400 hours / week (10 FTE) we can (if desired) on-demand part-time on-site.\n\nBecause we have almost completely centralized and digitized the recruitment and administration of flex workers, the Onsite Consultant is completely unburdened. As a result, the Onsite Consultant can fully focus on the workforce management of the flex workers and the operational and account management of Smurfit Kappa. The final selection interviews with the flex workers are scheduled onsite by the recruiters at Smurfit Kappa and will be conducted by the local Onsite Consultant, because he or she knows Smurfit Kappa best and can therefore make the final match."
231,"Which model (classic, broker, MSP and others) would you like to propose for Smurfit Kappa.","In view of the shortage on the labor market in 2019 (everyone is looking for the Smurfit Kappa profiles), we propose to choose option 1, the model with two preferred suppliers. The preferred suppliers must then have national coverage and there is no division based on locations and / or volume. In this way, Smurfit Kappa does not put all its eggs in one basket and the local operation and HR still have something to choose. The actual performance per location (proof) is then determined by the supplier's market share, because in practice one supplier is stronger than another supplier in a specific region, and vice versa.\n\nIn addition, the preferred suppliers must also work well together, so that they can act jointly on site at the large locations. This allows you to make optimal use of the strengths of multiple parties, for the sake of a larger Smurfit Kappa factory.\n\nThe degree of unburdening with a preferred supplier model with two suppliers does not have to be inferior to the unburdening of a Master Vendor model, as the workload with regard to unburdening (onboarding, planning, pool management, retention, administration, communication, etc. ) is distributed pro rata and is secured in an SLA."
232,Do you see yourself as a Master Vendor for our organization. And if 'Yes' you can indicate where (at least 3) you act as a Master Vendor / Broker.,"Through years of knowledge and experience, Gi Group has everything it takes to be the Master Vendor of Smurfit Kappa. In addition, Gi Group has national coverage in the Netherlands, which means that we can serve all Smurfit Kappa locations. Thanks to our on-site model, we are also able to still offer a high quality of service to the more remote locations and the locations with fewer hours at Smurfit Kappa.\n\nSome customers, of which we Gi Group is the Master Vendor, are:\n1. B&S Holland Trading Group\n• Sector: production (health & beauty) / logistics\n• Countries: The Netherlands\n2. Syncreon:\n• Sector: logistics\n• Countries: The Netherlands, Germany\n3. Lear Corporation:\n• Sector: production (automotive)\n• Countries: Brazil, UK, Germany, Italy, Spain, Poland, Slovakia, Czech Republic\n4. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA)\n• Sector: production (automotive)\n• Countries: Italy, Spain, Poland, France, Brazil."
233,Have you had implementation processes that are comparable to Smurfit Kappa? Please have at least 3 references.,"Gi Group has gained extensive experience over the years with implementation and migration processes at customers in the production and logistics sectors with volumes in hours similar to Smurfit Kappa, both within and outside the Netherlands.\n\nWe have worked out the implementation and migration process step by step in a process description and always work with a detailed task list and planning. Together with Smurfit Kappa we guarantee a flawless and silent performance.\n\nSome examples of recent implementation and migration processes in the Netherlands are:\n• B&S Holland Trading Group:\n- Sector: production & logistics\n- Locations: Farmsum, Veendam, Dordrecht, Spijkenisse\n• Syncreon:\n- Sector: logistics\n- Locations: Waalwijk, Tilburg, Venray, Maasvlakte, Schiphol\n• Meneba\n- Sector: production\n- Locations: Rotterdam, Wormerveer"
234,"How can you unburden Smurfit Kappa, what role do you wish to play in this?","Part of this question has already been answered in question 9. We advise Smurfit Kappa to opt for a preferred supplier model with two nationally operating temporary employment partners. Both preferred suppliers can be present on-site at the large Smurfit Kappa locations, so that the workload can be proportionally distributed based on the current market share per supplier.\n\nDue to the volume in hours, we can offer Smurfit Kappa a high degree of unburdening in areas, such as:\n• Onboarding (flex workers)\n• Workforce Management (flex workers)\n• Planning and pool management (flex workers)\n• Time registration\n• Billing\n• (Additional: Contract Management of sub suppliers)\n\nGi Group takes care of the recruitment, planning, workforce management and all communication (possibly to an additional sub-supplier), so that Smurfit Kappa has a Single Point of Contact for all questions and services. Smurfit Kappa discusses with the Single Point of Contact, the Onsite Consultant, such matters as:\n• To request\n• Forecast\n• Employer Branding\n• Problems"
235,Indicate how the level of experience of Uzk is safeguarded. Eg the difference between an experienced forklift truck driver or 1 who just has his certificate.,"During the recruitment phase, a candidate's level and experience are determined by obtaining two references, after which a driving test follows at the relevant Smurfit Kappa location in the presence of the Onsite Consultant and an experienced Smurfit Kappa employee.\n\nOnce a flex worker is employed at Smurfit Kappa, the level and experience are assured by introducing the competence once in the planning and / or workforce management software and updating it annually."
236,You must submit a proposal for a Service Level Agreement and the associated KPIs.,"The Service Level Agreement (SLA) is the most important document between Smurfit Kappa and Gi Group and describes the cooperation and agreements between both parties. The purpose of an SLA is to make binding agreements about the quality parameters of the service and about the reports. Performance and services provided are continuously measured with Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) defined in the SLA. We believe that we need to measure key figures (KPIs) to manage our organization and to continue to learn. We do this Gi Group broadly, but also specifically for Smurfit Kappa. We share the results monthly via an Excel export from our system and discuss them at regular consultation moments.\n\nGi Group proposes the following KPIs to Smurfit Kappa:\n• Fulfillment rate (= the number of successful placements vs. number of applications)\n- 99% on forecast\n- 95% other\n• Complaints (= the number of complaints on an annual basis)\n-"
237,Are you able to deploy flex workers for the deployment of weekly and daily schedules without intervention and / or consultation with Smurfit Kappa.\r\nAnd if 'yes' you can indicate how you can do this.,"Yes, Gi Group is able to deploy flex workers for the deployment of weekly and daily schedules without intervention and / or consultation with Smurfit Kappa.\n\nThe planning of permanent and flexible personnel can be arranged by Gi Group if desired. Every week Gi Group collects the hiring needs of every hiring manager within Smurfit Kappa. We will receive the capacity requirement from Smurfit Kappa no later than Thursday, so that we can complete the planning on Friday. From this information we make a planning based on competencies, based on; hours, costs, services or productivity. This guarantees Smufit Kappa complete delivery with maximum competences at the lowest possible price. Hiring managers can no longer call a person by name, which in most cases adds to costs. In the event that the daily schedule differs from the weekly schedule for reasons such as; disease, no show or unexpected production increase, Gi Group will compensate for these ad hoc deviations through the use of pool management.\n\nThe deployment of personnel is a dynamic process. Goals change, the workforce changes, the workload changes and so the planning has to change, both in the long and in the short term. More and more processes have been digitized. The employees have online access to the timetable and can submit changes themselves. This means that the planning must be continuously adjusted. Our planning software has been specially developed for companies with highly variable staffing levels, shifts and for companies that work with flexible personnel. It takes into account the applicable collective labor agreement, the Working Hours Act and other laws and regulations. Within the frameworks set by Smurfit Kappa, employees have the option of self-rostering via PC, tablet and smartphone, with the 24/7 App. If something changes in one schedule, the other schedules will automatically adjust accordingly."
238,"How does your organization deal with the planning of flex workers, which forms of planning can be integrated and what advice can your organization give on how Smurfit Kappa should deal with this. Which IT resources are used for this and are there any costs involved.","This question has largely already been answered in question 16. We mainly advise Smurfit Kappa to choose the right planning software. The packages we use, such as Planday and Tempbuddy, are equipped with all the latest functionalities in 2019, making planning a lot easier than using outdated planning software. The user-friendliness and design of these packages means that the software takes over part of the repetitive tasks of a planner, so that less time is needed for planning and fewer errors are made. Think of the mutual exchange of services, but also of a handy ranking of flex workers based on the flexibility actually shown. Of course everything works via a handy App.\n\n Gi Group advises Smurfit Kappa on planning on matters such as:\n• Where are the bottlenecks?\n• Where and when is cross training / education necessary?\n• When should recruitments be set up to anticipate peak periods in time?\n• How can we improve forecasting together? (based on historical data)\n• What pool size is needed per target group?\n• What is the optimal pool composition?\n\nThere are no additional costs for Smurfit Kappa for facilitating the planning of flex workers and the use of planning software, this has already been included in the conversion factor."
239,What training budget does your organization make available and how is it structured?,"By default, Gi Group reserves the statutory 1.02% as a training budget in the cost price for flex workers in phase A. Because we want to invest optimally together with Smurfit Kappa in the development of flex workers, we reserve more training budget than the statutory standard, namely a total of 2.0 %, for flex workers in phase A.\n\nBy investing more in the development, training and education of flex workers, we can also retain flex workers for longer at Smurfit Kappa and Gi Group, increasing the average length of stay per flex worker. We also see a clear correlation between development, training and education on the one hand and the performance of a flex worker on the other. We are happy to determine the allocation of this training budget together with Smurfit Kappa, so that we can offer Smurfit Kappa tailor-made solutions per location."
240,What options are there to transfer 'Unspent training funds' to the next calendar year.,"The statutory / CLA 1.02% must be issued in the year in which it is reserved or the following year.\nFor the remaining 0.98%, Smurfit Kappa is free to draw up its own rules. Gi Group does propose not to leave this for longer than the reservation year plus one year."
241,How does the organization deal with digitizing all national assessment and evaluation moments;,"Various solutions are possible for this. Which produces the best results for Smurfit Kappa depends on a number of things. It is also important to take into account GDPR legislation.\n\nGi Group can facilitate Smurfit Kappa in this. For example, we have a possibility within our MyGi environment to do this. This guarantees privacy, security and shareability."

243,What are your top 10 clients in The Netherlands? What percentage of your revenue do they account for?,"1. B&S Holland Trading Group\n2. Syncreon\n3. Meneba\n4. Axalta\n5. Geevers Autoparts\n6. GEFCO\n7. ID Logistics\n8. ABB\n9. STEF Logistics\n10. B&S Global Transit Center\nThe top 10 clients of Gi Group in The Netherlands, they account for approximately 74% of the yearly revenue."
244,"Indicate what interest Smurfit Kappa will have in you as a customer? Indicate which position, based on the indicative turnover, Smurfit Kappa will have with you as a customer.","In all stands, Smurfit Kappa will be treated by Gi Group as an XL key account, and Smurfit Kappa is of great strategic importance to Gi Group. This means that we will do everything we can to keep flex workers happy and Smurfit Kappa as a customer happy.\n\nIn addition to the Onsite Consultants and the national Operations Manager, the Smurfit Kappa Account Team will also include the Recruitment Manager, Sales Director and Country Manager. The XL key accounts are a fixed part of the weekly agenda of the entire MT, in which all departments are represented, namely; Operations, Recruitment, Marketing, Sales, Finance and HR.\n\nOn the indicative turnover from the tender document, Smurfit Kappa will take the 6th customer position at Gi Group."
245,What activities do you have with Smurfit Kappa outside The Netherlands?,"Anno 2019 Gi Group is a supplier of Smurfit Kappa in the UK and Portugal. Gi Group was also one of the major preferred suppliers of Smurfit Kappa in Italy until the beginning of 2016. The turnover in Italy at the time was approximately € 2,000,000. In Spain we also maintain contacts with Smurfit Kappa with Mr. Eduardo Monteiro."
246,"It is customary to divide the labor market into three segments, namely the bottom, middle segment and top of the labor market. The level of education is usually used as the benchmark for this distribution. The lower end of the labor market consists of jobs that do not require a basic qualification. It therefore concerns jobs for which an elementary level or a VMBO or MBO-1 level is required. The middle segment consists of jobs for which MBO 2 to 4 level is required and at the top of the labor market these are jobs for which HBO or university is required. Indicate which segment of the labor market you serve and with what percentage?","The Gi Group brand in the Netherlands mainly supplies flex workers in the production and logistics sectors. Within these sectors we focus on the following profiles:\n• Logistics worker \n• Reachtruck chauffeur\n• Chauffeur with a driverslicense B \n• Production worker \n• Operator\n• Administrative employee\n• Receptionist\n• Data-entry employee \nThe above profiles, which we largely fill in through the supply of flex workers, are a mix of VMBO or MBO-1 level and MBO 2 to 4 level.\n\nThe Grafton brand in the Netherlands provides the services; Recruitment & Selection, Secondment and ZZP brokering. Grafton consists of the divisions:\n• Logistics & Supply Chain\n• Office & HR\n• Finance & Accounting \nGrafton focuses on candidates from MBO 2 to 4 level up to HBO and University level. We also have a division under our own brand within Grafton, namely; Fashion & Luxury.\n\nGi Group accounts for approximately 86% of our annual turnover and Grafton for the remaining 14%. This is mainly because Grafton largely works on the basis of Recruitment & Selection."
247,How do you see / assess the labor market and its influence on Smurfit Kappa? Can you explain how you can support us in this.,"Due to the sustained growth of the Dutch economy, resulting in a historically low unemployment rate of 3.9% (August 2018), there is a major shortage of suitable personnel across all sectors and at all levels. This means that companies like Smurfit Kappa will have to distinguish themselves from the competition, who are looking for similar profiles in order to attract and retain the talented employees.\n\nThe “WHY” of a company now determines the “DNA” of the company and this translates into a proposition and the final product. Nowadays it is no longer just about the remuneration, this must of course be in line with the market, but about the total experience at a company. So also consider matters such as work environment, atmosphere, development of the employees, collecting and using ideas, involving employees, events such as; get-togethers, corporate parties, birthdays and seminars are crucial. This also demands something from the leadership of the board and management.\n\n“Practice what you preach!”, So Gi Group is at the forefront in this area. We advise our clients on employer branding and recruitment strategy. We really see recruitment as customization per profile, location and region. Together with the local operation and HR, we determine the best mix of recruitment channels and the ratio of online and offline marketing. The competition and SWOT analysis gives us more insight. Gi Group is extremely data-driven, we measure absolutely everything. Through AB testing and data analysis, we know which channel mix works best per profile and per region. We also combine this with smart original offline campaigns, in which we use referral and modern applications, such as Whatsapp and QR codes, hand in hand. We are happy to tell Smurfit Kappa more during the presentation rounds."
248,What options do you have to promote Smurfit Kappa as a top local employer (Employer Branding).,"We like to think along with Smurfit Kappa about employer branding. Nowadays, whether or not an employer branding strategy makes the difference in the tight labor market. We see significant discrepancies in attracting and retaining talent between companies with a strong brand and culture and those that do not have this advantage.\n\nTogether with Smurfit Kappa we make a SWOT analysis, in which the key points related to; “Why candidates would like to work at Smurfit Kappa” has been incorporated. We compare this SWOT analysis with a (local) competition analysis, after which we determine together which of the strengths we use in labor market communication and which recruitment channels we will use. We always keep costs vs. the expected result sharp in the eye. After we have determined the strategy together with Smurfit Kappa, we make an action plan and a schedule. During our consultation moments, employer branding is a fixed item on the agenda below\n\nIn addition to advising Smurfit Kappa on employer branding, Gi Group itself also invests in increasing its brand awareness through social media campaigns via channels such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Jobboards, Jobcrawlers, as well as through our sponsorships with Scuderia Toro Rosso. F1, AC Milan and FC Wolfsburg, volleyball team Monza where we are the “Official HR Partner”."
249,"How do you see the collaboration model with Smurfit Kappa. For example, do you employ a second party as a subcontractor, or are you willing to work with other agencies that are complementary?","Gi Group uses sub suppliers for two specific reasons:\n• Quality; in cases where a specific question (profile) requires a specialized supplier.\n• Quantity; When a volume request is so challenging at any given time, it takes multiple suppliers to meet it.\nGi Group works with a trusted selection of sub suppliers for both quality and quantity issues.\n\nGi Group focuses on flex workers living independently in the Netherlands. If Smurfit Kappa prefers to work at certain locations with flex workers residing outside the Netherlands, Gi Group can deploy its regular sub-supplier in this area, or work with the current supplier (s) of Smurfit Kappa."
250,Is it important to have a minimum turnover level in order to maintain a certain service level? And if 'Yes' what is the minimum level?,"From the Gi Group service model, we always work from the customer location. Thanks to this Onsite model, we are able to be more present at Smurfit Kappa at locations with small volumes than our competitors. From a volume of 400 hours / week (10 FTE) we can (if desired) on-demand part-time on-site.\n\nBecause we have almost completely centralized and digitized the recruitment and administration of flex workers, the Onsite Consultant is completely unburdened.

The front and mid office use the   SalesForce   platform and the back office of Microsoft Navision, from which we also load all data via the   SalesForce   Einstein data warehouse into clear dashboards. This gives Gi Group the opportunity to analyze in detail all data that   is released   in the process from inflow, through flow to outflow, and make it available to Huhtamaki.

This gives Gi Group a detailed and realistic picture of the job market in the   Franeker   region and gives Huhtamaki an advantage over competing companies in the region looking for the same type of profiles. We can even map the current employment conditions of the companies in the region using public data that is accessible to us.    Some examples of data are:     Insight into recruitment feasibility: what percentage of your target group   is actively and / or latently looking  ? How scarce is your talent? How often are these accessed?      Insight into where and how you can reach your target group: through which media   channels   can I reach the active and latent target group? Which (pull) factors set him or her in motion? What are their hobbies and interests?      Insight into the (regional) labor market: what   is the average salary offered  ? Who are your competitors? How long are vacancies open on average?      The right target group information to manage realistic expectations towards Huhtamaki.     In Appendix   A   we give Huhtamaki a preview of the possibilities that this target group dashboard will offer us when we enter into a partnership with each other.    Search    Gi Group has a Central Recruitment Team (CRT). This is a centralized and specialized recruitment team of serious size, based in Amsterdam. Thanks to the CRT, we are able to scale up and down very quickly for our customers, because we can schedule recruiters in blocks of 3 hours for our customers throughout the Netherlands. The CRT is responsible for recruitment, pre-selection, reference checks, talent pool management and the scheduling of face-to-face conversations with our Onsite Consultants. The CRT has the latest IT applications and, in addition to the traditional telephone   line, also   makes extensive use of WhatsApp (messages / video), SMS, Facebook and FaceTime.

Online channels include social media such as; Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn,   but also   channels such as www.gigroup.nl, Google Adds and our own database. In addition, job boards are also used. These are digital boards on which vacancies and CVs   are published  , for example Indeed,   Neuvoo  ,   Nationale     Vacaturebank  , Werk.nl and regional platforms. Offline channels   are also actively used   in campaigns. There are many ways to search for suitable   candidates   offline for a vacancy. For example, flyers   are hung up and distributed around business parks, public buildings and supermarkets where Huhtamaki\'s competitors are located  . Vacancies   are also published   in local newspapers and referral campaigns are used (for example tell-a-friend promotions with a reward). When people get recommendations from people they trust, they are more likely to take the step.    Selection    After the pre-selection on hard criteria by the CRT, the   interviews are scheduled by the CRT   for the Onsite Consultant, who then makes the final match on soft criteria. The live interviews always take place on-site at Huhtamaki. The Onsite Consultant knows exactly what Huhtamaki is looking for, who fits the culture and values of Huhtamaki and knows not only the measurable competences, but also the softer characteristics that make an employee suitable for the vacancy. By conducting the interview in a structured way using smart interview techniques (for example STAR), we get a reliable picture of the behavior of an applicant in work situations. If large groups have to enroll at the same time, we sometimes choose to organize group sessions. We sometimes use assessments for more complex roles.    Bind    Labor is human work. By giving flex workers the right attention, turnover, absenteeism and no show   are reduced   and involvement is increased. By drawing up a retention plan, we ensure that the flex workers have a bond with Huhtamaki and Gi Group. Four needs are central to the retention plan; work,   pay,   attention and development.    After the right match, the guidance of the flex workers begins. Gi Group guides the flex workers placed at Huhtamaki in a human, yet structured way. The flex workers   are guided   because:     Gi Group wants to contribute to the labor market and develop and train flex workers based on this core value;    Gi Group is the official employer and attaches importance to satisfied flex workers;    A satisfied flex worker likes to go to work;    A satisfied flex worker performs better;    A satisfied flex worker is not very absent and stays longer at Huhtamaki.     The Gi Group Onsite Consultants are responsible for guiding flex workers. The Onsite Consultants are the experts in this field and   are supported   by our colleagues from the staff departments at the head office. Thanks to our many years of experience, we know exactly what our flex workers expect from us as an employer. Based on this knowledge, a coaching process   has been developed   in which the flex worker is central.    The retention plan for Huhtamaki can include:     Maintain as much contact as possible with the flex workers and know what is going on. This in a smart mix of as much on-site presence and contact over online channels as possible;    Streamlined onboarding; in which we offer clarity and structure in addition to a warm welcome;    Personal guidance during the induction period;    Contact moment at the end of the first working day and first working week;    Check for needs / motivation for a personal training program;    Monitoring progress during the training process;    Contact moment at the end of the trial period together with manager Huhtamaki;    End of the first month of probationary interview;    Structured evaluation moments (every quarter);    Compliance with Huhtamaki assessment system;    Show appreciation by means of Christmas gift, birthday card and reward for extra effort;    Structural employee satisfaction survey."
263,What contribution could you have to the employer branding of Huhtamaki?,"Our marketing specialists and your Onsite Consultant are happy to think along with Huhtamaki about employer branding. Nowadays, an employer branding strategy or no employer branding strategy makes the difference in a tight labor market, even now that more people are available due to the Corona pandemic. We see significant discrepancies in attracting and retaining talent between companies with a strong brand name, culture and large marketing budget and those that do not have this advantage.    Together with   Huhtamaki   we make a SWOT analysis, in which the key points related to; “Why candidates would like to work at Huhtamaki” has been incorporated. We compare this SWOT analysis with a (local) competition analysis, after which we determine together which of the strengths we use in labor market communication, such as recruiting and SEO proof vacancy texts with an attractive layout, but also custom advertisements that we use via online - and offline channels (see question 1). We also determine together with   Huhtamaki which   channel mix we will use. To arrive at a channel mix, we do AB tests, in which we try multiple channels and variants of advertisements, so that we can measure what gives the best results in the   Franeker   region. We always keep costs vs. the expected result sharp in the eye. Because we can analyze all data in   Mysolution  , our HR software, handy dashboards allow us to see which campaigns are most successful. After we have determined the employer branding strategy together with Huhtamaki, we make an action plan and a schedule. Employer branding is a fixed item on the agenda below during our meetings (see Appendix B: communication matrix).    From our vision, employer branding can only be achieved if the internal organization supports this image and there is commitment at all levels; before and during the execution, both on the side of Huhtamaki, and on the side of Gi Group. Communication of texts, images and videos are especially important during the recruitment and selection phase.   But   what was communicated during recruitment and selection must become apparent in reality during the introduction, the induction process, development and in the working environment at Huhtamaki. External communication is about what, but especially how you communicate. The content must be consistent, honest and in line with the culture, target audience and predetermined message. In addition, the form also determines   to a large extent   how the message comes across.   Who\'s   speaking?   What\'s   the tone? How does it look? For example, do you want to position yourself as a young, innovative organization with a focus on fun? Then the communication must radiate this. Is development one of your spearheads? Then make sure that this is reflected   again and again   in your communication.    In addition, it is important to understand the candidates, so that together we can make Huhtamaki more interesting for them. Part of understanding the candidate   is understanding   where their interests lie. In addition, it is essential to look at where this specific group of   candidates can be found, so on which platform. With this information, suitable vacancies   can be written   on the right platforms.    Another possibility that Gi Group hopes to put into practice in the future at Huhtamaki is to make videos about the temporary workers who will start working at Huhtamaki. This gives an idea of ??what a working day at Huhtamaki looks like. Interviews   can also be held   with the temporary workers, in which they can tell about their work experience and perception.    Finally, we will look together at a content strategy and we can advise Huhtamaki on how smart more attention   can be paid   to increasing brand awareness on social media. Ultimately, we can only be successful in employer branding and marketing if our team can work closely with the team within Huhtamaki who is responsible for this."
264,Which clients with a comparable need do you have within a radius of 25 km around the location (Franeker) of Huhtamaki?,"Our closest customer is Bakker   Logistiek  , with branches in   Heerenveen   and   Zeewolde  , among others.    We also serve many customers in Flevoland (including   Lelystad  , Almere) and Groningen (including   Farmsum  ,   Veendam  ,   Kolham  ).    It does not matter to Gi Group at which location in the Netherlands a company is located, as long as we can grow (quickly) to a volume of at least 1,000 hours per week. In the past 4   years   we have grown so quickly to more +50 onsite locations, spread throughout the Netherlands, including on-sites in very remote areas.    Because we have the right resources to gain real-time insight into your local labor market and our model is based on the deployment of a local Onsite Consultant supported by centralized and digitized departments for recruitment, administration and planning, we can develop in   Franeker  .

265,"With what methods do you quarantee the quality and functioning of the temp workers, measure and report this?","Recruitment     During the recruitment of flex workers, various steps have been built in to check the quality of the temporary worker in advance:    Telephone screening (availability, willingness to work shifts, motivation, certificates, language, etc.);    Reference check;    Face2face intake at location Huhtamaki by Onsite Consultant (deeper into competencies, shifts, motivation, culture match, general impression);    Conduct (language) tests or assessments for senior and office   positions.

Interim   assesment       Interim assessment is always in consultation with the customer, as an assessment system has often already been set up. Gi Group\'s standard procedure is as follows:     Evaluation first day (by telephone by Onsite Consultant)    Evaluation first week (by phone by Onsite Consultant)    Evaluation first month (preferably on site by Onsite Consultant, if desired with the manager of the flex worker)    Evaluation after six months (on location by Onsite Consultant, preferably together with the   flexworker\'s   manager)    Annual evaluation (on location by Onsite Consultant, preferably together with the   flexworker\'s   manager)     All assessments and communication   are recorded   in   Mysolution  , Gi Group\'s HR system.    Ongoing processes    In addition to the formal evaluations, the Gi Group Onsite Consultant also regularly has an informal conversation with the managers and flex workers, so that any pain points   are quickly identified  . Our goal is to be on site as much as possible, especially during shift changes, so that we hit the people.    Training     Together with Huhtamaki, we draw up a training plan per profile per person, whereby we will fully utilize the training reservation of 1.02% of the gross salary in phase A.    Reports    In line with the agreed consultation structure (see Appendix B: communication matrix), a report will be published in which the assessments are communicated. These reports also include details such as absenteeism, not showing up, arriving late, etc. We would like to talk to Huhtamaki about the requirements and wishes regarding this report."
266,"How do you think you can spend the 1.02% reservation for training at Huhtamaki? In addition, are there currently interesting subsidy options for Huhtamaki related to the use of (flexible) labor? If so, which ones and how can these be used in practice?","Schooling reservation    Training is a very important ingredient to bind and captivate flex workers. Specialized technical knowledge is a great addition to the production at Huhtamaki. We propose to select flex workers together with Huhtamaki and to annually offer a group of outstanding people (as a guideline the aforementioned evaluations) a training course, for example Operator MBO 3, or another training that meets   Huhtamaki\'s   training needs. In doing so, the flex workers become more specialists, all-rounder deployable in the pool and Huhtamaki can offer them career opportunities, increasing the chance of Huhtamaki retaining these stars.    Another group we can offer language training, safe working training, forklift or manager training. This is in consultation with Huhtamaki to give shape, whereby the outcome of the evaluations of the temporary workers also indicate a direction.    Subsidies     We propose to distribute the following subsidies, which   are paid out   and apply to the population of flex workers who work at Huhtamaki 50/50 through Gi Group. Huhtamaki will then receive the 50% part of the subsidy after it   has been paid   to Gi Group.

Stimulating and promoting sustainable employability involves career, learning, development, health and finances. DOORZAAM distributes training vouchers to temporary employment organizations as a financial support for flex workers. The flex worker can use the voucher to choose one or more training courses, courses or training courses up to a maximum of € 500 incl. VAT. Upon receipt of these training vouchers, Gi Group will also make them available to flex workers deployed at Huhtamaki.    DOORZAAM:    https://www.doorzaam.nl/loopbaan/scholingsvouchers/   ."
267,"What posseblities and experience do you have with the training of forklift drivers and operators, what is the pricing and what part will you take for your own expense?","The costs for lift, reach or narrow aisle truck training are fully covered by Gi Group from the budget of the 1.02% training reservation that we build up for flex workers in phase A (78 weeks). We train a large part of our logistics temporary workers through BLOM training courses. At the request of our client, this   can of course also be done   via another training institute in the   Franeker   region.    Together with Huhtamaki, we can select temporary workers and annually offer a group of excellence (as a guideline the aforementioned evaluations) training, for example Operator MBO 3. In doing so, they become more specialist and Huhtamaki can offer them career opportunities, thereby increasing the chance of retaining   these excellence   by Huhtamaki.    An example of a training that we regularly purchase for our customers in the production sector is  :     https://www.opleiding.nl/opleiding/mbo-vakopleiding-procesverbetering.html?open=brochure-lite&course=a9f3a7ac-78ba-4c8a-819e-42658a9b0f73            This training is at MBO-3 level, but shortened to the essential courses that are required for process operators and the costs are approximately € 2,630. A full MBO-3 training for process operator costs € 6,685. For the latter   training   it is a requirement that Huhtamaki is a recognized training company. We are happy to coordinate with Huhtamaki the exact percentage that Gi Group takes care of for this type of training, because this depends on how the total training budget is spent and for   this   we must first properly map out the volumes and wishes."
268,"""A good start is half the work"". The better a new employee is informed, the lower the unwanted outflow and the higher the productivity. In what way and with what means do you guarantee optimal ""onboarding"" of new employees and what can this all include?","Everything depends on the timely availability, maintenance and registration of the most up-to-date and correct information in one system. In this Gi Group has a “fetch duty” and Huhtamaki a “fetch duty”.    Sales    In our opinion, the design of the onboarding already starts with the start-up of a new customer. Sales has answered the questions from the customer during the commercial process and, together with operations, devised the solution in the form of related services. The agreements   are laid down   in an SLA and this is offset by a tariff. This information   is entered   by sales in   Mysolution  , our HR software, where the entire cycle of processes from inflow,   throughflow   to outflow and invoicing come together. Sales always remains closely involved during the implementation phase and works together with operations. Sales organizes a handover meeting, where all information is shared and discussed with colleagues from all departments such as; operation, recruitment, planning, finance and administration.    Recruitment    Recruitment also plays an important role in informing flex workers, because recruitment establishes the first contacts with the prospective flex workers for Huhtamaki. The recruiters must therefore be well informed about all the   ins   & outs at Huhtamaki and maintain short lines of communication with the Onsite Consultants.    CPA    The administrative process   is completely taken   over by the Onsite Consultant by our CPA department, so that the Onsite Consultant can focus on account management and workforce management. CPA has no contact with the customer, but only with the flex workers. CPA takes care of all administrative matters concerning flex workers (hirer\'s remuneration, contracting, time processing, wage payments, corrections, leave, illness, etc.) and maintains the   1st   line of communication with the flex workers. As a result, we deploy specialists in the administrative process, which reduces the error margins and the flex workers have quick answers to their questions. Before CPA can send a flex worker his or her employment contract for the digital signature,   all mandatory   and signed documents must be uploaded from the placement in the system and CPA must follow all instructions that we have specified specifically for Huhtamaki in   Mysolution   our HR -software. Think of things like; deposit forms, collective labor agreement, safety instructions, non-disclosure agreement, explanation, planning, time registration and company assets, such as shoes and clothing. We make a working-by-booklet especially for Huhtamaki, in which the most important things   are clearly described  . The Onsite Consultant goes through this work-by-booklet extensively with the flex worker. These documents and instructions are easy to find for flex workers at any time via the online candidate portal, which is also accessible via an app. The safeguarding of all these process steps in   Mysolution   contributes to a positive experience for the flex worker of the onboarding.    Onsite operation    In our opinion, nothing beats personal contact, so our Onsite Consultants are often on-site during the onboarding and induction period to inform, guide and answer questions for the flex workers. In   this   we always look for the triangle with production and HR of Huhtamaki, because only together we can optimally fulfill this period of information and instruction.   ?"
269,"Huhtamaki requests a Master Vendor (brokerage) role from her partner. If you cannot foresee yourself, engage other agencies that meet all the conditions set in the job profiles and against the agreed (financial) conditions. Do you agree with this? Do you already have (potential) partners in the region, if so which ones?","Yes, we agree with this.    Yes, we have both local partners and nationally operating partners. In the   answer   we primarily focus on our technical partners, as we expect to mainly need support from our partner database in the field of the heavier profiles, such as TD and experienced Operator.    A selection of our technical partners:     Xelvin      Jobz  -on      IJssel Technology      Techsharks      AB Vakwerk     Our colleague Joost Vinkenvleugel, Business Unit Director Grafton, has a particularly extensive network in the technical niche market and will play a supporting role in the background.   Esther de Haan, Gi Group Operations Manager, also knows the Frisian market well, as she was born and raised in Friesland."
270,"By accepting the role of Master Vendor, your organization declares that it indemnifies the customer from any liability towards sub-suppliers deployed by your organization (as Master Vendor). Do you agree with this?","Yes, Gi Group is responsible for managing the sub-suppliers.    In concrete terms, this means that we apply the same rates and conditions to the sub-suppliers, as agreed between Huhtamaki and Gi Group. Gi Group will also take care of all communication towards the sub-suppliers, about operational matters such as  ;   vacancies, onboarding and planning, so that Huhtamaki only has one single point of contact, namely the Gi Group Onsite Consultant."
271,"Given the information in the introduction and your own knowledge of Huhtamaki; is the ""traditional"" in-house role necessary in your view? If not, how do you organize the necessary attention, if so how would you implement the in-house role? Which tasks, roles, activities contribute most to Huhtamaki\'s goals?","In our opinion, the onsite model is the only way   to properly implement   the HR partnership that   Huhthamaki   aspires to. Gi Group therefore does not have a branch network and is always onsite with its customers, whereby the onsite presence   is linked   to the hours per week (see question 11). The close interdependence between the two organizations in the deployment of a large group of flex workers on the basis of posting in a so-called triangular employment relationship, combined with the requirements and wishes with regard to service provision from Huhtamaki, means that regular but efficient communication is the only key to success. The Corona pandemic has taught the world to adapt to more remote communication through channels like; Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Skype for Business, etc. What has also become clear is that personal physical contact on the work floor is indispensable to strengthen a relationship and to arrive at creative solutions together.    However, these activities   can easily be done   from a distance, such as:     Search    Pre-selection    Assessments    Marketing    Administration     Report    Planning and pool management    Replace no shows    Master Vendor service    Show up checks      Activities, where onsite presence is required, are      Implementation and migration    Final selection rounds    Introduction (onboarding, instructions)    Tours     Company equipment; safety shoes, uniforms, PBM, access cards, etc.    Schooling     Show up checks     Evaluations and assessments      Work meetings (weekly, monthly, quarterly  )    We   can also perform the above activities that are mentioned in the case of physical on-site presence, remotely. However, we strongly prefer to carry out these activities on-site with a physical presence."
272,How do you propose to organize this at the start of the implementation?,"With a volume of 60,000 hours per year, converted 1,150 per week, Gi Group guarantees an in-house occupation of at least 2 days per week. Due to the flexibility in our model, we can easily adapt our in-house presence to the needs during peak times, during implementation and migration and during final selection interview rounds.    Thanks to our onsite model with mobile consultants, who are supported and unburdened by the CRT, CPA the   Flexpool   Coordinators and our Staff departments, we are generally   more present   in-house than our competitors with a volume of 60,000 hours per year. The presence and occupation of the in-house office partly depends on the number of flex hours per week. If the number of hours falls below the number agreed in writing (60,000 hours / year), Gi Group reserves the right to adjust the daily staffing accordingly.    We will involve Huhtamaki in the process of selecting a suitable in-house employee."
273,Describe in a short process flow what your process of planning and pool management will look like in the context of Huhtamaki\'s desired planning methodology described in the introduction (planning for availability and competences across departments and teams).,"The success factors for making and executing the planning and pool management are always communication and the planning tool, both towards each other, and towards the internal organization and flex workers. Because we still have insufficient knowledge of the planning processes at Huhtamaki at this stage, other than what   is described   in the RFP documentation, it is difficult to create a process flow. We have therefore based the process flow below   on the basis of   our knowledge and experiences with similar production customers.     1 week before planning, a proposal planning is made by Gi Group based on the forecast from Huhtamaki;    When the proposal schedule is ready, it is available to the team leaders within 48 hours. The team leaders have access via their own login to our planning system to make real-time adjustments;    The team leaders have access 5 days before the planning starts. 2 days before the planning starts, they must have entered the changes (think of dividing services, competencies and positions according to their own wishes)    We send out planning 2 days in advance for two weeks later;    The team leaders can always monitor in real-time what is happening in the planning, so when we make a proposal for a change, the team leaders are also watching. We all see one schedule;    We distinguish two phases in our planning system, namely proposal planning and actual planning;    After changes, we consult with the team leaders and these changes   can be refuted   within 24 hours. In short, we always keep in touch with the team leaders;    Per department, we schedule a short operational meeting with the team leaders once a week to discuss the changes;    The flex workers receive an email or text message with the services (in coordination with Huhtamaki);    Pool management is organized on the basis of functions and availability;    Planning is organized   on the basis of   departments, teams, positions and competences.     The   Mysolution   planning tool takes into account the applicable collective labor agreement, the Working Hours Act and other laws and regulations. Within the frameworks set by Huhtamaki, employees have the option of self-rostering via PC, tablet and smartphone, with the 24/7 app, in the event of ad hoc changes. If something changes in one timetable, the other timetables will automatically adjust accordingly. Gi Group advises Huhtamaki on planning and pool management on matters such as:     Where are the bottlenecks?      Where and when is cross training / education necessary?      When should recruitment start in order to anticipate peaks in time?      How can we improve forecasting together? (based on history)      What is the optimal pile composition and size?      Which mix of target groups works best per profile and / or department?"
274,With what planning system do you operate and is the opportunity there fort he customer to make use of that system (in the future)?,"Planning system    We work with our own planning system, integrated in the cloud solution of   Mysolution  , which forms the heart of our digital front, mid and back office. This is the best HR software on the market for HR service providers. The team leaders in production also get their own login to the planning system, to make real-time adjustments and always see what is happening in the planning (see the answers to questions 12 and 22 for more information about the planning system  . )  .        Clock system   ?   ?  We   also propose the clock system to implement   Nedap\'s   PEP Flex.    Flex workers clock in and out with their    ?  personal PEP card at a PEP Reader.          PEP registers the clocked hours of the flex workers. The hours   are approved   by those responsible and then go to the salary package in   Mysolution   and Gi Group that can process the hours for invoicing.         ?  The PEP system also keeps track of the contract hours and leave balances. This is always clear to those involved.    Clocking in on the PEP Readers can   be done   upon arrival, but can also be done by cost plate, line or activity, for example. The readers are equipped with a battery and make contact with one PEP gateway that collects all information and sends it to the PEP software. The collection and forwarding   is done   via the GPRS network by means of a SIM card that is built into the gateway. This will give you a wealth of information about how much and how long work has been carried out to cost center / activity level.   ?   ?    In addition, the manager has the option to view all hours worked in the current and previous weeks of the employee. The hours and entitlements accrued are also transparent. Both the accrued hours / rights and hours worked and allowances are transparent to the employee. It is possible for the manager to make a total overview of the hours worked and to export this. PEP Flex   is already linked   to   Mysolution  , so that we can digitally enter the hours via an interface. This reduces the error margins and we can see in real time who   is clocked   in, which makes attendance checks a lot easier. Running reports is   aslo   easy.     The costs for the implementation and use of PEP Flex are already included in our pricing."
275,"Huhtamaki has a fairly flat hiring pattern with peaks for Easter, Christmas and during the holiday period. How can you guarantee that as many of the same, well-worked-in forces are used again?","The basis of qualitative pool management is good and frequent communication with the candidates in the pool. The communication is a mix of personal contact through channels, such as; telephone, email, WhatsApp, SMS and social media and automated messages via   SalesForce     Pardot  , our marketing automation tool, which is fully integrated into our HR software   Mysolution  . If you give enough attention to the candidates in the pool, the pool will remain more filled and up to date. Both the Central Recruitment Team and the Onsite Consultants have a role in pool management. Below we describe three solutions to bind well-developed forces so that they   can be used   again at a later stage.    Shield model         By using a shell model, in which we apply   4   layers in the pool, we can better categorize and retain flex workers. Not everyone wants to work as many hours a week as possible.     Permanent employees of Huhtamaki;      (Almost) full-time flex workers; create volume in the workforce; also   by not always deploying   everyone full-time, so that a surplus in the pool becomes available. This keeps the quality and stability high;      Part-time flex workers  ;   for peaks in the week and weekends.      Holiday forces / peak forces; flex workers only used to absorb peak times and holidays. In addition to students, you can also think of part-time parents or state pensioners.   ?       Reservation of over hours     What we also use for our customers is to encourage the flex workers in layer D to work overtime, so that after the peak, we pay these hours in phases in order to keep this group of flex workers longer with Huhtamaki.      Pool sharing    A third solution is the use of pool sharing, whereby the flex workers   are also deployed   at other Gi Group customers. For flex workers living independently in the Netherlands, we combine working at Huhtamaki with work within a maximum travel time of 45 minutes, but for migrant workers, for whom we also provide housing, transport, insurance, etc., this is possible with our customers throughout the Netherlands. . If we also deploy labor migrants at Huhtamaki, Gi Group can have the machine instructions translated into English, so that we can also deploy English-speaking flex workers during peak times."
276,"How do you specifically plan to build up the flex pool (students) and the holiday pool? And how do you keep in touch with this target group ""from day to day"" during calls, changes, etc.?","Recruitment    This target group of students requires a different approach than we use for regular vacancies. For this target group we make more use of social media channels such as Instagram, Snapchat,   Tiktok  ,   etc.Possibilities   for offline campaigns (such as at MBO / HBO schools, universities, sports associations or other channels) are also included.    From reports displayed by our recruitment software, we can immediately measure and manage the success factors during each campaign.    Keeping contact     Keep in touch with the pool by telephone, WhatsApp, SMS or other popular channels through a fixed schedule.   And   send automated, but personalized messages at important moments such as birthdays, graduation, new year transition. The aim is to maintain the pool.    Reward system     The options for retaining this target group can also include a reward system that   can be saved   for something per hour worked. This will certainly ensure maintenance of the pool in the summer period."
277,"Huhtamaki is considering outsourcing the planning of permanent staff to the chosen partner (in the near future). Sketch the working method, conditions and indicate how, for example, team leaders can also work in this. Please provide examples from comparable customers.","See the answers to questions 12, 13 and 22. We can easily add the planning of permanent staff to this, but there are additional costs involved.    As an example, we would like to name our customer   Simei   in   Lelystad  ,   Inditex\'s   ironing center."
278,"Work out a concise action plan for the implementation period, including a migration plan, with at least the following content:","A planning including a well-developed communication and migration plan, including concrete detailed steps, milestones and a critical path, in which it is clear that the (activities for the) implementation will be ready within 8 weeks.    The composition of a dedicated project team, including one central contact person;    A description of the manner of aftercare after the implementation phase;    A description of what   is expected   of the customer during this period.     In our opinion, a successful implementation / migration consists of   5   elements:    1. A qualitative implementation team, composed of experienced professionals (at all levels), who have already completed many migrations  ;    2. A migration team that is already involved during the RFP phase, so understands Huhtamaki\'s expectations, wishes and requirements;    3.   Freeing   up extra resources during the implementation / migration, so that we always have enough people to complete this process on time and properly;    4. Thorough preparation, planning, control and implementation;    5. ""Cooperate"" in advance as a flex worker in the departments, so that the onsite teams understand the operational activities and requirements at Huhtamaki   well.      In   our opinion, a successful implementation / migration consists of   5   elements:    What we expect from Huhtamaki is:     Good communication    Support and involvement on all levels    Insight in stakeholders      ?        Care after the implementation face     Even after the implementation phase, we will be more than usual on-site on location at fixed times, so that the flex workers can contact us with all their questions and we will handle this for Huhtamaki. Personal contact is the key here. During the first few weeks, we regularly check per person whether everything is going well with the salary and whether everything is clear regarding the candidate portal and candidate file. We also put the implementation and migration, the first two months, on the agenda of the regular consultation moments with Huhtamaki. In addition, flex workers can always call our CPA department, which   is specially designed   to answer first-line questions from flex workers. The back-office specialists know the ins and outs with regard to remuneration, legislation and regulations and the application of the hirer\'s remuneration at Huhtamaki, so quickly remove any ambiguity.    2. Customer expectations during implementation and migration    The starting point is that we unburden Huhtamaki during the implementation and migration as much as possible and that everything runs smoothly. Huhtamaki must be able to remain fully focused on the core activity, namely production and for the flex workers, only the logo above the salary slip must change and the rest remain the same and familiar.    The expectations in the form of actions   can be found   in the schedule under point 1. Gi Group also provides Huhtamaki with a complete package, including all documentation for the releasing party, information sheets, FAQ, presentations for the kick-off meetings and information sessions with flex workers, but also action and decision lists, etc. are ready to use. Thanks to our extensive experience with implementations and migrations of groups of tens to hundreds of flex workers, this is   in good hands   with Gi Group.   That\'s   a promise.   ?"
279,We would like to receive a proposal for an SLA for Huhtamaki. Be specific and concise! Can you confirm that this proposal has been sent to j.voerman@tisg.nl?,"Proposal Service Level Agreement for cooperation between Huhtamaki and Gi Group    The master vendor role that Gi Group takes up is central to the service. In addition to a total delivery responsibility, Gi Group   can also be held   accountable for the quality and performance of the delivered goods. The agreements made in the contract and the Service Level Agreement therefore relate to all flex workers supplied to Huhtamaki via Gi Group.   How the collaboration between Gi Group and other agencies is organized is a responsibility of Gi Group (the master vendor) and will therefore not form part of this contract.   The points listed below are a summary of the agreements between Gi Group and Huhtamaki in the field of service provision.    The aim of this SLA is to make binding agreements about the quality parameters of the service provision and about the reporting that should lead to an improvement in the quality of the service.    The KPIs   have been added   to indicate the importance of a number of specific points within the whole of Gi Group\'s services.    Management information    Management information will be provided by Gi Group   every 4 weeks at various levels. This information   will be discussed   during the 4-weekly and quarterly evaluation moments as included in the communication matrix (see Appendix B: communication matrix)    Quality    Evaluations are regularly carried out in accordance with the schedule to keep the quality (performance, reliability,   competences  ) of the flex workers as high as possible and to continuously monitor and improve them. On average, the outcome of all evaluations must be at least “satisfactory” overall.    Phase management    Gi Group identifies the phase in which the flex worker is. This signaling   is discussed   once every 4 weeks in the operational consultation.    Accessibility Gi Group    We work with our   Flexpool   Coordinators in shifted shifts between 06:00 and 22:00 hours 7/7 and offer 1st line self-support as an IT solution between 22:00 and 06:00.    The self-support   functionality,   fulfills the replacement demand, by automatically sending a message to the reserve pool of candidates, allowing the available flex workers to schedule themselves to fill the shift. Thanks to this automated smart tooling, any other candidates who have also responded will be unsubscribed and the shift   will be confirmed   to the flex worker who has acted the fastest. The remuneration system rewards the most flexible flex workers. A lot is possible in the field of remuneration, but we are happy to coordinate this personally with Huhtamaki.    During the week, our Onsite Consultants normally work within office hours, so from 08:30 - 17:00, but if the client\'s duty roster makes it smarter to start the day structurally earlier, for example, we sometimes opt for shifted shifts.    Outside the weekday working hours of the on-site operation, other solutions   can also be devised   to meet the replacement demand. An example of an alternative solution is:    Daily up-to-date reserve pool in   Mysolution   with substitute workers, which   is managed   by a senior flex worker or a Huhtamaki team leader, who approaches the candidates by telephone. An advantage of this can be the personal contact and that you approach specific candidates first.    Information material    Gi Group will use or compile information material that is made available to flex workers who are placed at Huhtamaki. Keeping this information material up-to-date lies with Huhtamaki. Gi Group will always provide the latest version to the flex workers.    Safety    Gi Group will ensure that all flex workers   are informed   about and sign a statement that they are aware of the applicable health and safety rules within Huhtamaki. Gi Group must also ensure a 100% comprehensive check on subjects such as work or residence permits (in the case of non-Dutch flex workers). Gi Group will ensure that all flex workers have the correct safety shoes (S3 = standard and is reimbursed by Gi Group).   Other personal protective measures and clothing for flex workers will be purchased by Huhtamaki  ."
280,"Which standard do you think you will set for the first 4 KPIs, which other KPIs would you like to add and how will you report these?","Part of the management information is a set of fixed KPIs containing at least the following KPIs:     Services requested and provided (Delivery percentage, gross and net> 4 hours before start).    (  unwanted  ) turnover percentage.    Provision for ad hoc questions (requested services on a daily basis     KPIs on correct time processing and invoicing.    Average hourly rate development.     Standardization of the first   4   KPIs Huhtamaki:     Services requested and provided (Delivery percentage, gross and net> 4 hours before start): 97%    (unwanted) turnover rate: 3%    Provision for ad-hoc questions (services requested on a daily basis     KPIs on correct time processing and invoicing: 99% accuracy (if hours are delivered digitized)    Development of the average hourly rate: In view of the increasing reduction in youth wages, we expect to achieve little savings with the target group of young people. We   can, however, actively deploy   the use of holiday workers and those entitled to AOW, for which a more competitive cost price applies.   Andere   kpi’s   die Gi Group voorstelt: Ziekteverzuim: 4%, No shows eerste werkdag: 1%              We share our KPIs through a report that we can generate at any time from   Mysolution   our HR software with real-time information, available in handy dashboards. These reports   are shared   with Huhtamaki on a monthly basis before the start of operational meetings. We calculate all KPIs on the average of a period of one year."
281,The process at Huhtamaki requires 24/7 availability in case of unexpected (replacement) demand. How are you going to organize this?,"Through our systems, which are all interconnected, we are able to provide 24/7 support to support.    In this process, Huhtamaki and flex workers   are connected   to each other by means of the portals that we make available to customers and flex workers. Communication between the portals is supported and by   Mysolution  , our HR software and coordinated by our planning system.    In order to achieve maximum results on replacement issues, our advice is to introduce a reward system in which the flex worker is the stakeholder in this.    We work in shifted shifts with our   Flexpool   Coordinators between 06:00 and 22:00 7/7 and offer   1st   line self-support as an IT solution between 22:00 and 06:00 (see figure 1).    The self-support   functionality,   fulfills the replacement demand, by automatically sending a message to the reserve pool of candidates, allowing the available flex workers to schedule themselves to fill the shift. Thanks to this automated smart tooling, any other candidates who have also responded will be unsubscribed and the shift   will be confirmed   to the flex worker who has acted the fastest. The remuneration system rewards the most flexible flex workers. A lot is possible in the field of remuneration, but we are happy to coordinate this personally with Huhtamaki.         ?

An advantage of this can be the personal contact   and also   that you approach specific candidates first."
282,Do you have any experience with Vendor Management Software?,"Yes, we manage through our software MySolution multiple apps to source candidates. The benefits this offers are speed, intelligent data and reporting so we can continuously improve the sourcing. The software from MySolution can be integrated with any system on demand."
283,Could you give some more information about the IT system you use?,"A lot of investment is made over the last years in MySolution software. It monitors and meassures the input from which channels are qualified and outstandig employees come from. Business cases, AB testing and data analysis, are developed by the adjustment of tools that are the most efficient. Gi Group continues to adjust the software to the needs to serve our clients in the best possible way. All our tooling, the provides in an end-to-end candidate/client journey,  are imbedded in our central front-, mid- and backoffice. Mysolution on the SalesForce platform, so we can analize and report all data very easily."
284,Could you elaborate on your fullfilment and respons times?,"If there are no specific qualifications required, we can fulfill the frontline position within 2 business days. Assignments for frontline with certificate or diploma's will be more difficult to fulfill within 2 business days. White-collar assignments can be fulfilled within 7 business days. Because of our central planning and the central recruimtment department, we can fulfill the assignments rapidly. If needed, we will put extra effort into recruitment, so the dedicated recruiters will receive help from their collegues. We are willing to give away 0,01% on turnover for not filling assigments on time."
285,How does your onsite service model works? Also take in considoration the covid pandamic in the answer.,"Where traditional agencies often operate from branches, our Consultants always work from a customer location and hereby partly fill in for Client . They are an extension of Client  and because of the (part-time) On-site presence, they know exactly what is going on in the operation and with our flex workers. We are physically present onsite for more hours than the standard at temporary employment agencies and are convinced that this is the only right way to achieve maximum retention and performance.In our opinion, the onsite model is the only way to properly implement the HR partnership that Client  aspires to have. Gi Group therefore does not have a branch network and is always on-site with its customers, whereby the on-site presence is linked to the hours per week. The close interdependence between the two organizations in the deployment of a large group of flex workers based on temporary employment in a so-called triangular employment relationship, combined with the requirements and wishes with regard to service provision from Client , means that regular but efficient communication is the only key to success. The Corona pandemic has taught the world to adapt to more remote communication through channels like; Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Skype for Business, etc. What has also become clear is that personal physical contact on the work floor is indispensable to strengthen a relationship and to find creative solutions together."
286,Could you explain how the Dutch regulations are around anti-criminal statements for temporary workers?,"In The Netherlands, it is common to provide a VOG. If this is required by Client , Gi Group will request the VOG for the flex worker in the system of Justice. After the request has been made, the flex worker has to log in with his personal user name and password and pay for the VOG. The flex worker can send prove of payment to Gi Group after working full-time for 4 weeks. The payment of the VOG will be paid back to the flex worker. Medical checks are controversial in NL, definetely not common. And Drugs screenings are not allowed in The Netherlands."
287,"Could you describe the operational proces around temporary worker, around sickness due to an accident?","We would let the temporary worker fill in an accident form. Client  will be held responsible because it is responsible for the management and supervision. Gi Group saves the form and contacts the temporary worker. The registration of absence or sickness will go through Acture, our partner where we outsourced sickness management, they are taking over the contact and payment if someone is sick or not able to work anymore. Acture also coordinates the process in case of long-lasting sickness or occupational disability, especailly when there is a ""Arbo"" Doctor involved. After, the temporary worker will receive its sickness payment and enough medical attention to make sure the worker receives the care he or she needs. In case of an EU flex worker, Gi Group can make an appointment with a doctor and make sure the worker receives guidence from the care taker."
288,"Please explain the process of how you will manage transitioned assignments and temporary workers from another supplier.  How do you validate if the temporary worker has earned any vacation time, holiday pay time and other benefits.  How will you ensure the temporary worker is not impacted and does not lose any of the benefits earned with their existing employer by transitioning to our program?","The process of migrating temp workers from another party is described later in the sheet ""implementation plan"".  The vacation time, holiday money and other reservations made by the temp at the losing party, have to be paid by the loosing party directly to the temp."
289,How do you manage your temporary worker's accrued benefits?,"Our software tracks the accured benefits by our temporary workes automatically, based on their hourly gross salary. If they use the benefits, it will be adjusted automatically in the system."
290,"Cost containment and YOY productivity is a business imperative, please explain what are the different levers you will use to fulfill this business requirement?","We will fulfill the business requirements first of all by tracking all our processes. Also, we will conduct many evaluations in order to find the right employee. This way, the costs but also the productivity will increase. Nevertheless, we will make use of SMART planning. There will be multiple available employees and several competences for the different profiles. This way, they can work on different profiles instead of only one profile. More continuity will also be implemented. Lastly, we will closely cooperate with the client on evaluation, productivity and planning in order to together see what is going well and what could be improved."
291,"As part of your recruitment process, does your company offer an employee referral bonus?","Yes, sometimes with difficult profiles or areas we do offer refferal bonuses to find the right candidates. Our current employees receive a bonus, for instance a gift card, after someone they recommended has worked a certain amount of hours at Gi Group."
292,Please explain the process of how you will manage shared assignments and temporary workers engaged in other clients' projects.,"It is very important to us that our workers have an equal work-rest balance. We implement a number of activities in order to make sure our workers do not make too many hours. For instance, our planningtool blocks itself if too many hours are being processed. Nevertheless, the care taker regulary checks on the personal health of the workers. Also, all legislations are integrated in our planning system so there will not be any misunderstandings about those legislations."
293,Could you describe the worksplit around accountmanagement and operational management?,"For the The Netherlands, the account management will be conducted by the national Accountmanager, Operational Manager and the Onsite Consultant. The accountmanager is responsible for communicating on a tactical and strategic level with the client and making sure the cooperation will go smoothly. The Operational Manager is the backbone of the onsite consultants and makes sure that everything onsite goes well. The daily consultant is the direct contact person of the client but also of the temporary workers. If there are questions or other points to dicuss, the daily consultant is the go to person."
294,Could you describe the team for the Client?,"Recruiter Recruitment is responsible for finding and establishing a match between the candidate and the vacancy. Wants and needs need to be fulfilled from both perspectives, since both parties will develop from this on the long run. This starts with the beginning of the search via different media channels, where we approach candidates by email or phone to tell them about the vacancy. During this conversation, we discuss for instance general company information, employment conditions and starting date. When the candidate shows interest, the administration starts. We process all intake notes in our ATS. After, the consultant plans a second interview with the candidate. Finally, the candidate will be introduced to the client and with the agreement of the client, the candidate can start working.  Backoffice (CPA) We as CPA are the core of the company. We make sure that all hours are correctly processed in the system and that the candidates receive their payments on time. We check and send the contracts and have a lot of contact with the candidates about different topics. We are available for every question, including questions regarding the hours, contracts but also general questions. We are attainable from Monday till Friday from 9 AM till 5 PM. We keep track of everything regarding expiring contracts/ extension of contracts, sickness registration and payment, signing contracts, sharing information with (new) candidates, are the worked hours processed on time and so on.

He or she is always looking for the best possible options when it comes to planning, short-term and long-term."
295,Can you briefly describe how you guarantee the welbeing of your cross-border flex workers?,"Thanks to our own network of recruitment and selection offices in Europe, our screening is of high quality and people are tested on experience and skills by conducting personal interviews in the country of origin. We are a people-oriented organization that pays maximum attention to the candidate with the aim of captivating and binding people. We ensure optimal attendance and flex workers who are flexible in terms of employability, working hours and work size. We offer full service and that means: • International recruitment; • Travel to the Netherlands; • Housing, SNF certified (max. 4 people); • Transport; • Daily support (personal attention); • Supervision of new employees on the 1st day.  Every cross-border employee is maximally facilitated by us in his or her means to be able to work in the Netherlands and to be successful in the daily work at the customer. Our support of the people is focused on 5 things from which the customer reaps the benefits."
296,Does Gi Group provide housing?,"We are SNF certified and have a registration in the hiring register, where we are inspected annually to see if we adhere to the set standards. We have our regular partners who facilitate us in offering locations where the quality of the offer is central. All accommodation is located within a 30-minute travel time radius to the work location."
297,What role do you play with regard to absenteeism management and how do you support Client  in reducing this?,"Attention works, that is Gi Group's vision. Being on site regularly and keeping in touch with the employee ensures more job satisfaction and therefore less absenteeism.  Absenteeism is mapped by the Bradford factor if desired by Gi Group. When the factor exceeds 100, actions are taken. Those actions consist of: • Consultant schedules a meeting with the employee to discuss absenteeism. Of course, taking into account what the Consultant is not allowed to ask by law and without notice of the possible nature of the illness if the employee chooses to tell this. • Consultant advises employee to take action. • Consultant advises employee to remain in discussion with the team leader about possible areas for improvement in the field of working conditions.  As soon as the employee is ill, the administrative department remains daily in contact with the employee. The consultant will also contact you if you are absent from work for more than 5 working days. If desired, contact is maintained on a daily basis with the direct supervisors of the employee about when the employee expects to be better again."
298,How would you arange optimal poolmanagement and create flexibility for the Client?,"If Client  lets go of certain requirements, the recruitment of candidates will be easier. This extends the flexibility and size of the flex pool.  Naturally, this must be able to fit into Client 's business processes. The current shortage on the labor market requires a solution-oriented approach with regard to the availability of candidates. We are happy to discuss with Client  what is feasible to ensure that continuity and flexibility come together as effectively as possible. We expect that we need knowledge of daily practice to provide appropriate advice.  An example of creating flexibility is the use of the ""shell model"" below;  This model usually consists of four layers:  1. permanent Client  employees; 2. (almost) full-time flex workers; create volume in the workforce; 3. part-time flex workers; during peak times of the week; 4. holiday workers / peak workers; flex workers only used for peak periods and holidays."
299,"How can you help with the scheduling, planning and timeregistration?","Forecast: It starts with a forecast, which is made based on numbers and competencies. In addition to the forecast, you have your pool of employees and flex workers. The people in this pool all have certain competencies and contractures. In PEP these competences and contract hours can be assigned per person. In addition to your total pool, you have your available pool. Based on the competencies they have, the forecast and the other available employees, you can determine whether you want to approve the requested leave. By comparing the forecast and the available pool per competence, you know what to act on. This includes training staff, deploying employees from other departments or deploying flex workers.  Scheduling: The schedule will primarily be filled in with permanent (flex) employees (strategic). At peaks that are known in advance, greater use can be made of the flexible shell. During unexpected illness or peak times, extra flex workers will be scheduled (operational). The schedule is compiled in PEP as follows: • Own employees and flex workers indicate their availability online. • Your Gi Group in-house consultant draws up and fills in the roster based on the specified occupation per task and shift. • Flex workers and employees can be scheduled based on a number of planning conditions such as availability, position, competences and rostered hours. Based on this, PEP makes suggestions for the most suitable employees. As soon as the timetable is final, the consultant can publish the timetable at the touch of a button. • Scheduled employees are informed about the schedule by means of a message and can view their schedule. PEP also records the hours of all people who are at work. Whether these are own employees or flex workers. Employees and flex workers clock in and out with their personal PEP only at a PEP Reader. PEP registers the clocked hours of the employees. The hours are approved by those responsible and then go to the salary package and to Gi Group who can process the hours for invoicing. Clocking in on the PEP Readers can be done upon arrival, but can also be done by cost center or activity. The collection and forwarding is done by means of a built-in SIM card. This will give you a wealth of information about how much and how long work has been carried out to cost center / activity level. If an employee or flex worker has clocked in or out, the manager can see who this is in real time in PEP. In addition, the manager has the option of viewing all hours worked in the current and previous weeks of the employee. The hours and entitlements accrued are also transparent. Pool management In order for a planning system to work, we will create a pool of candidates based on a medium and long term planning. From this pool we can fulfill new services, accommodate outflow and replace No Shows. If flexibility and the associated planning are not properly arranged, there is a risk that flex workers will not be deployed enough hours to meet their minimal financial need. A too high turnover is the result. We can make an important difference by securing his / her minimum income for the flex worker. The way in which Gi Group designs its flex pools takes these needs into account. As a counterpart to the above wish, when all flex workers from the flex pool are deployed almost all available hours, there is no longer any possibility to absorb unexpected peaks. The scalability is then gone. For example, we compensate for this by having part of the pool consist of part-timers who are less income-dependent, such as students, holiday workers, two-income earners, AOW beneficiaries and possibly subsidy candidates, the so-called layer model. We also rotate the person who does not work, so that the result of the fluctuations does not have major consequences for the income of the flexworker.  Information/reporting: Because you compile the timetable in the same environment and also observe the time registration, a complete flow of information about and for each location is created. Think about: • Occupancy rate per location. • How is each site performing? • What is the ratio of permanent employees versus flex workers? • Does my schedule match what actually took place and where are the gaps? • Insight per cost center / activity how many hours are worked here. • Insight for both manager and employee in the accrued hours and rights. You will find all this in a simple interface.  Knowledge: The data that enters PEP is converted into information. With this information, knowledge is increased and action can be taken to, among other things, achieve a better occupancy rate. Also think of insight into the different activities to determine exactly where the most hours are worked and whether this corresponds with the budgets. The simple and fast insight into the accrued hours of employees also ensures that nobody is faced with surprises anymore."
300,Could your provide business intelligence data from the labor market?,"Gi Group uses the Mysolution software, an all-in-one solution, where the front, mid and back office are fully integrated in one system. This gives Gi Group the opportunity to analyze in detail all data that is released in the process from inflow, through flow to outflow, and make it available to Client . In MySolution, Gi Group has also integrated the Intelligence Group target group dashboard, so that we have all the necessary information regarding supply analysis, labor market analysis and target group analysis. This gives Client  an edge over competing companies in the region that are looking for the same kind of profiles. We can even map the current employment conditions of the companies in the region using public data that is accessible to us. Examples are: • insight into recruitment feasibility: what percentage of your target group is actively and / or latently looking? How scarce is your talent? How often are these accessed? • insight into where and how you can reach your target group: through which media channels can I reach the active and latent target group? Which (pull) factors get him or her moving? What are their hobbies and interests? • insight into the (regional) labor market: what is the average salary offered? Who are your competitors? How long are vacancies open on average? • the correct target group information to manage realistic expectations towards Client"
301,What is your advice regarding reversed billing?,"Gi Group is familiar with reversed billing from clients. Our software is set up for this. If necessary, for example in the event that Gi Group acts as Master Vendor, we can also apply reversed billing towards sub suppliers. We use the Microsoft Navision software within MySolution for this."
302,"Could you describe the topics cover during an account review with a large, global account pertaining to the services outlined in this RFP?","We describe the following information during an account review; points of evaluation, performance, partnership, plans, forecast, adjustments in contracts, company, all levels of cooperation, hick-ups, other suppliers, evaluation of KPI's, problems that occur, how to prevent future problems, etc."
303,Please provide the performance business standards you measure for temporary labor services?  How often are these business standards reviewed and by whom?,"We measure the following business standards; Time to fill compliance, First time quality, Fulfillment ratio, Turnover, Sickness rate, Invoice accuracy, No Shows, Failure to start, Payment terms. These standars are monthly reviewed by Sales Manager and Operational Manager together with The On Site Consultant(s). We prefer to also discuss the standards together with our client on Monthly base."
304,Describe your company's quality assurance program?,"In The Netherlands we are certified  NEN 44001-SNA, SNF certified for housing of cross-border workers and are a full member of the ABU since 2017."
305,Describe how your organization measures customer satisfaction. what actions are taken when your customer satisfaction and service quality goals are not achieved.,"Our organization measures customer satisfaction and service quality by customer evaluation, which allows us to draw a picture of how the customer experiences our service. Also, we plan periodic consultations with the client to discuss what is going well and what needs improvement. We think it is important to search for the exact cause of the problem, in order to solve this problem and thereafter look for possible solutions. We will also measure the KPI's through our system MySolution, which can make realtime reports on a very detailed level."
306,What percentage of your fees are you willing to put at risk to support the Performance Guarantees described above?,"We will determine a ratio and clear definition for every KPI. If we cannot service Client  according to this ratio, we are willing to give a compensation in a penalty/bonus scheme that need to be determined in a later stage."
307,As part of servicing the account can you provide fork lift training and certification? .,"Yes, we work with different suppliers who can provide, among others, fork lift training and certificates. The supplier we mainly work with is BLOM. They have many sites in The Netherlands and can plan on short-term trainings. If a temp worker wants or needs a certificate, we will first make an inventory of the current experience level. After, we will plan the training according to the workers schedule, training can be conducted in week- or weekend days. We will ask the trainee to sign a contract for the costst of the training. If the trainee quits the job, they will have to pay an amount back to us, this amount will lower after more hours worked through Gi Group. Mostly we will train and certify them at BLOM https://www.blomopleidingen.nl/heftruck/"
308,How do you retain resources that have been forklift certified?,"There are many aspects we focus on, in order to retain our resources. First, it is important to provide the resources a clear planning and a fulltime schedule. They should work as many hours as possible, so the more the better. Second, they must be paid an equal and fair amount. Nevertheless, we must ensure the payments are paid on time without a delay. Last but not least; we reall take care of our workers, by walking the extra mile for them. Those are the main reasons for ceritified workers to keep working with us. If we keep the workers satisfied, they will not leave our company."
309,24/7 temporary labor fulfillment and customer service support is critical to ensure continuity of services.  Are you able to provide this service?,"Through our systems, which are all connected with each other, we are able to provide 24/7 support. In this process, Client  and flex workers are connected by the portals that we make available to customers and flex workers. Communication between the portals is supported by Mysolution, our HR software, and coordinated by our planning system. In order to achieve maximum results on replacement issues, our advice is to introduce a reward system in which the flex worker is the stakeholder. We work in shifted shifts with our Flexpool Coordinators between 6 AM and 10 PM 7 days a week and offer 1st line self-support as an IT solution between 10 PM and 6 AM.    The self-support functionality fulfills the replacement demand, by automatically sending a message to the reserve pool of candidates, allowing the available flex workers to schedule themselves to take over the shift. Thanks to this automated smart tool, any other candidate who has responded as well, will be unsubscribed and the service will be confirmed to the flex worker who responded the fastest. The remuneration system rewards the most flexible flex workers. A lot is possible in terms of reward, but we would like to coordinate this personally with Client . During the week, our Onsite Consultants work normally in between office hours, so from 08:30 AM - 5 PM. but if the customer's schedule makes it smarter to start the day structurally earlier, for example, we sometimes choose shifted shifts. Outside the working hours during the week of the on-site operation, other solutions can also be devised to meet the replacement demand. An example of an alternative solution is: Daily up-to-date reserve pool in Mysolution with stand-in workers, which is managed by a senior flex worker or a Client  team leader, who approaches the candidates by phone. An advantage of this can be the personal contact and also the approach of specific candidates first."
310,How will you ensure that Client  is only billed for hours worked?,"We propose the clock system to implement Nedap's PEP Flex. Flex workers clock in and out with their personal PEP Reader. PEP registers the clocked hours of the flex workers. The hours are approved by those responsible and then go to the salary package in Mysolution and Gi Group, that can process the hours for invoicing. The PEP system also keeps track of the contract hours and leave balances. This is always clear to those involved. Clocking in on the PEP Readers is possible upon arrival, but can also be done for example by cost center, line or activity. The readers are equipped with a battery and make contact with one PEP gateway that collects all information and sends it to the PEP software. The collection and forwarding is done via the GPRS network by means of a SIM card that is built into the gateway. This will give you a lot of information about how much and how long work has been carried out to cost center / activity level. \n\nIn addition, the supervisor has the option to view all hours worked in the current and previous weeks by the employee. The hours and entitlements accrued are also transparent. Both the accrued hours / entitlements and hours worked and allowances are transparent to the employee. \n\nIt is possible for the manager to make a total overview of the hours worked and to export this. PEP Flex is already linked to Mysolution, so that we can digitally input the hours via an interface. As a result, we reduce the error margins and we can see in real time who is clocked in, which makes attendance checks a lot easier. Running reports is also easy. \n\nThe costs for the implementation and use of PEP Flex are 0,07 euros per worked hour. These are the costs the company invoices to us. \n\n"
311,How do you prevent unwanted turnover (attrition)?,"There are many aspects we focus on, in order to retain our resources. First, it is important to provide the resources a clear planning and a fulltime schedule. They should work as many hours as possible, so the more the better. Second, they must be paid an equal and fair amount. Neverthless, we must ensure the payments are paid on time without a delay. If we keep the workers satisfied, they will not leave our company."
312,Please explain your company's overtime policy for temporary workers?,"We always monitor the worked hours of our temporary workers. In case the number of hours almost exceeds the maximum allowed number of hours by law (arbeidstijdenwet), our planning system will block. ""Arbeidstijdenwet"" is very complicated to summarize in this sheet. If Client  wants, we can send it separtely."
313,Define Client ’s role in the change management (including transition of services and implementation)?,"The starting point is that we assist Client  during the implementation and migration as much as possible and that everything runs smoothly. Client  must be able to continue to focus fully on the core activity, namely production and for the temporary workers, only the logo above the salary slip must change and the rest must remain the same. What we expect from Client , is to terminate the collaboration with the previous party, supply the documentation to the party and initiate a meeting for a smooth transition. Gi Group also provides Client  with a complete package, including all documentation for the releasing party, information sheets, FAQ, presentations for the kick-off meetings and information sessions with temporary workers, but also action and decision lists, etc. are ready to use. Thanks to our extensive experience with implementations and migrations of groups of temps to hundreds of temporary workers, this is in good hands with Gi Group. That is a promise."
314,How big is the coverage of Gi Group worldwide?,"The Group is active in the fields of temporary and permanent staffing, search and selection, HR consulting and training, as well as in a variety of complementary activities. Thanks to direct presence and strategic partnership, it operates in more than 57 countries across Europe, Asia, Africa and America.

In 2020 Gi Group supplied over 20,000 companies, with a turnover of 2,52 billion Euros.                                                                                 Today Gi Group is active in: • More than 57 countries; • More than  500 Branches and SMS (site managed service); • 110 SMS; • 5.300 Direct employees."
315,"How does Gi Group organises training, development and employee satisfaction?","eNPS: The eNPS (Employee Net Promoter Score) is a way to measure employee engagement with the company and find out which aspects you can improve. Our NPS score in 2020 was 39.3. Most companies consider an NPS of 0 to be respectable. A positive NPS is considered good and an NPS of +50 is considered excellent.  We score best on the following topics: • Organizational wellbeing • Innovation • Trust (in management and colleagues) • InvolvementThe HR structure HR cycle: The Gi Group HR Cycle consists of a goal setting meeting, a progress meeting and an assessment meeting. The goal-setting meeting and progress meeting are two-sided conversations between the manager and the employee.  In addition to the interviews that are part of the HR Cycle, managers have a 1 on 1 conversation with the employee every month. This is a two-sided conversation in which everything can be discussed. During these interviews, the manager will discuss with the employee how he or she is developing and which competencies he or she may need to develop further. If necessary, additional coaching or training can be used for this.  Gi Group promotes education, courses and training for employees during their careers within the organization because we believe it is important that our employees are well qualified and keep up to date with developments in their field. Gi Group therefore has an annual training program. This includes 10 training courses that our employees can register for. A.o. Agile working, speed reading, mind mapping and PowerPoint. Each year, these training courses are tailored to the needs of our employees and the organization. In addition to the annual training program, individual training courses are also possible."

318,Please summarize your organizations’ insurance coverage(s) and in particular to the services being contemplated under this RFP.,"Our insurance in The Netherlands covers up to 1.000.000 euros per occurance. Our Dutch insurance is a part of the international insurance, that covers to 15.000.000 per occurance."
319,Could you please describe your company's covid-19 protocol?,"Yes, our company has a Covid-19 operating procedure. We believe that the health and well-being of the temp workers is priority. The test policy is described in accordance with the applicable RIVM policy. This means that the testing policy can change if the situation in the Netherlands changes. RIVM guidelines are leading in this.  • Each new arrival (from a yellow area) is tested via a rapid test before entering the residential location. The test is performed by the Caretaker. In case of a positive test result, the employee is placed in quarantine. An employee who suffers from a cold or a fever must report this immediately to cpa@gigroup.com  • CPA will forward the report to the Gi Group corona contact point;  • The corona contact point (Gi Group) interacts with the GGD and immediately follows up on the advice of the GGD;  • Employees have themselves tested immediately and move to the isolation home within 48 hours pending the results;  • Until the result is known, the employee with symptoms will stay in the isolation home;  • If the test result is positive, the employee will stay in the isolation home and will update the corona contact person 3 times a day about the developments. This is done by email / WhatsApp, mainly at 08:00 - 12:00 - 17:00.  • With 24 hours symptom-free, the employee is fired from the isolation home and moved back to a residential location. The employee can resume work the following day. Besides, every accommodation has a list of products to prevent transmission; Quick tests, non medical masks, gloves, handalcohol gel, contactinformation medical contacts, poster of the Covid-19 measures of the house or car and flyers with the measures. The flyers and posters are there to educate and train the temp workers on the Covid-19 procedures. (The operating pamphlets and procedure for Covid-19 will be attached seperately, as well as the Covid-19 instructions of our Caretakers)"
320,How do you establish a cost saving by optimizing the planning?,"By planning on comptences with especially our Cross Border temps, we can improve the speed of filling unexpected gaps in the planning faster. This means a significant higher production for our clients."
321,What type of technology do you use for reporting and hour tracking? Do you provide access to your clients enabling full visibility of live/accurate data? ,"Gi Group Netherlands Use My Solution in Sales Force. In this program it is possible to make a portal per customer with custom made reports which show live/actual data. For instance we can show you the average hourly rate, the average multiplier, the amount of hours per week per department"
322,Could you describe how you retain the workers?,"Labor is human work. By giving flex workers the right attention, turnover, absenteeism and no show are reduced and involvement is increased. By drawing up a retention plan, we ensure that the flex workers have a bond with Client  and Gi Group. Four needs are central to the retention plan; work, pay, attention and development.  After the right match, the guidance of the flex workers begins. Gi Group guides the flex workers placed at Client  in a human, yet structured way. The flex workers are guided because: • Gi Group wants to contribute to the labor market and develop and train flex workers based on this core value; • Gi Group is the official employer and attaches importance to satisfied flex workers; • A satisfied flex worker likes to go to work; • A satisfied flex worker performs better; • A satisfied flex worker is not very absent and stays longer at Client . The Gi Group Onsite Consultants are responsible for guiding flex workers. The Onsite Consultants are the experts in this field and are supported by our colleagues from the staff departments at the head office. Thanks to our many years of experience, we know exactly what our flex workers expect from us as an employer. Based on this knowledge, a coaching process has been developed in which the flex worker is central.  Maintain as much contact as possible with the flex workers and know what is going on. This in a smart mix of as much on-site presence and contact over online channels as possible; • Streamlined onboarding; in which we offer clarity and structure in addition to a warm welcome; • Personal guidance during the induction period; • Contact moment at the end of the first working day and first working week; • Check for needs / motivation for a personal training program;M141 • Monitoring progress during the training process; • Contact moment at the end of the trial period together with manager Client ; • End of the first month of probationary interview; • Structured evaluation moments (every quarter); • Compliance with Client  assessment system; • Show appreciation by means of Christmas gift, birthday card and reward for extra effort; • Structural employee satisfaction survey."
323,Could you describe your recruitment and selection proces?,"Gi Group has a Central Recruitment Team (CRT). This is a centralized and specialized recruitment team of serious size, based in Amsterdam. Thanks to the CRT, we are able to scale up and down very quickly for our customers, because we can schedule recruiters in blocks of 3 hours for our customers throughout the Netherlands. The CRT is responsible for recruitment, pre-selection, reference checks, talent pool management and the scheduling of face-to-face conversations with our Onsite Consultants. The CRT has the latest IT applications and, in addition to the traditional telephone line, also makes extensive use of WhatsApp (messages / video), SMS, Facebook and FaceTime.  The CRT uses both online and offline channels. Online channels include social media such as; Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn, but also channels such as www.gigroup.nl, Google Adds and our own database. In addition, job boards are also used. These are digital boards on which vacancies and CVs are published, for example Indeed, Neuvoo, Nationale Vacaturebank, Werk.nl and regional platforms. Offline channels are also actively used in campaigns. There are many ways to search for suitable candidates offline for a vacancy. For example, flyers are hung up and distributed around business parks, public buildings and supermarkets where Client 's competitors are located. Vacancies are also published in local newspapers and referral campaigns are used (for example tell-a-friend promotions with a reward). When people get recommendations from people they trust, they are more likely to take the step.  After the pre-selection on hard criteria by the CRT, the interviews are scheduled by the CRT for the Onsite Consultant, who then makes the final match on soft criteria. The live interviews always take place on-site at Client . The Onsite Consultant knows exactly what Client  is looking for, who fits the culture and values of Client  and knows not only the measurable competences, but also the softer characteristics that make an employee suitable for the vacancy. By conducting the interview in a structured way using smart interview techniques (for example STAR), we get a reliable picture of the behavior of an applicant in work situations. If large groups have to enroll at the same time, we sometimes choose to organize group sessions. We sometimes use assessments for more complex roles."
324,How do you provide the Client with labor market information?,"In MySolution, Gi Group has integrated the Intelligence Group target group dashboard, so that we have all the necessary information regarding supply analysis, labor market analysis and target group analysis. This gives Gi Group a detailed and realistic picture of the job market in the Franeker region and gives Client  an advantage over competing companies in the region looking for the same type of profiles. We can even map the current employment conditions of the companies in the region using public data that is accessible to us. Some examples of data are: • Insight into recruitment feasibility: what percentage of your target group is actively and / or latently looking? How scarce is your talent? How often are these accessed? • Insight into where and how you can reach your target group: through which media channels can I reach the active and latent target group? Which (pull) factors set him or her in motion? What are their hobbies and interests? • Insight into the (regional) labor market: what is the average salary offered? Who are your competitors? How long are vacancies open on average? • The right target group information to manage realistic expectations towards Client ."
325,We require a 24/7 availability in case of unexpected (replacement) demand. How are you going to organize this?,"Through our systems, which are all interconnected, we are able to provide 24/7 support to support. In this process, Client  and flex workers are connected to each other by means of the portals that we make available to customers and flex workers. Communication between the portals is supported and by Mysolution, our HR software and coordinated by our planning system. In order to achieve maximum results on replacement issues, our advice is to introduce a reward system in which the flex worker is the stakeholder in this. We work in shifted shifts with our Flexpool Coordinators between 06:00 and 22:00 7/7 and offer 1st line self-support as an IT solution between 22:00 and 06:00.  The self-support functionality, fulfills the replacement demand, by automatically sending a message to the reserve pool of candidates, allowing the available flex workers to schedule themselves to fill the shift. Thanks to this automated smart tooling, any other candidates who have also responded will be unsubscribed and the shift will be confirmed to the flex worker who has acted the fastest. The remuneration system rewards the most flexible flex workers. A lot is possible in the field of remuneration, but we are happy to coordinate this personally with Client .  During the week, our Onsite Consultants normally work within office hours, so from 08:30 - 17:00, but if the client's duty roster makes it smarter to start the day structurally earlier, for example, we sometimes opt for shifted shifts. Outside the weekday working hours of the on-site operation, other solutions can also be devised to meet the replacement demand. An example of an alternative solution is:  Daily up-to-date reserve pool in Mysolution with substitute workers, which is managed by a senior flex worker or a Client  team leader, who approaches the candidates by telephone. An advantage of this can be the personal contact and also that you approach specific candidates first."
326,"If your organization has experience with a Master Vendor solution, can you describe it briefly?","Gi Group has a lot of experience in the Netherlands with similar constructions. We have both customers with large locations, where Gi Group has implemented a full Master Vendor, with a complete package of on-boarding, planning, pool management, time processing, billing and supplier management, as well as customers with small locations, for which we work together with the customer. have chosen the standard model.  A full Master Vendor offers a more extensive service than that of a supplier and consists of five extra elements:  1. Contract Management (Co-Vendors) 2. Workforce Management (flex workers) 3. Planning and pool management 4. Time registration (one flow) 5. Invoicing (one flow)  An SLA is drawn up that measures our process based on KPIs. These KPIs and our performance are always central during the consultation moments with Client . The Master Vendor, Gi Group takes care of the recruitment, planning, workforce management and communication to and from the Co-Vendor, so that Client  has a Single Point of Contact (SPOC) for all questions and services.  Client  discusses together with the SPOC topics such as: • Requests • Forecast • Employer Branding • Occured problems   A Master Vendor uses Co-Vendors for two specific reasons: • Quality; in cases where a specific demand requires a specialized supplier. • Quantity; When a volume request is so challenging at any given time, it takes multiple suppliers to meet it.  Our most important ‘Lessons-Learned’ are: 1. That the small locations often require more on-site presence than most broadcast partners offer with a small volume in hours; 2. That the tightness on the labor market is forcing clients to switch to a model with a larger number of temporary employment partners. Each supplier uses a unique mix of channels and target groups, which increases the delivery guarantee for Client . Customization per location is important. In this way, clients reduce the risk of failure to deliver and of a decline in productivity due to a low quality of flex workers; 3. That the percentage of EU flex workers in the pools is declining, because working conditions have improved significantly in Eastern Europe in particular. Looking at other source countries can be a solution (Gi Group also sources in Portugal and Spain, for example); 4. That the basis, the process and the structure of the service model must be solid as a rock. Client  depends on the broadcast partners to serve its customers well, so there is no room for an unstable performance."
327,What do you expect from Client  in order to achieve optimal cooperation?,"In order to achieve optimal cooperation, we expect Client  to open up (across the breadth of the organization), in order to grow towards a strategic HR partnership together with Gi Group. The basis for optimal cooperation are and will always be the people who shape this cooperation, this is the key to us.  In our opinion, the following common values are important to achieve optimal cooperation: •Communication: Everything starts with a committed team and listening carefully to each other. Without listening, no one is able to fully understand the causes of bottlenecks and / or problems, making it impossible to create a solution that delivers results. In our opinion, a communication structure in which we consult frequently and efficiently and remain focused on the content is a basic requirement. Equality in communication is an important starting point and that is how we keep everyone involved.  • Self-reflective ability: Self-reflection means looking at oneself and thinking about one's own actions while holding up a mirror to oneself. The degree of self-reflection partly determines to what extent a team can learn from its own experiences in order to do better in the future. In our opinion, self-reflection is a key to success.  • Ambition: By having a common ambition level, with which we always set the bar higher and want to surprise each other (+1), you create added value. With every project where we exceed the ambition, our relationship will strengthen and a strong sense of pride will arise. ""Cooperation gets way easier if you're doing something you deeply care about and believe in!""  • Creativity: By looking at (existing) problems and / or solutions together in different ways, you create new solutions. Brown paper sessions, design thinking and lean methods are examples of creative ways to arrive at these solutions. Sharing Case Studies and Best Practices from both organizations across countries can also contribute a lot.  • Maneuverability: Short lines of communication within an organization are a precondition for being able to switch quickly. In addition, both the organization and the people who work here must be able to deal with a climate of continuous change. Good leadership is crucial to keep a large organization agile. Client  and Gi Group together form one committed team, so agility is something that we guarantee."
328,Does Gi Group use other innovative recruitment tools?,"We have integrated the NIXZ recruitment robot into our process to automate simple repetitive tasks. Once we have taught NIXZ what to do, the robot will take over the basic tasks of our recruitment department. When we give the NIXZ robot a job opening, it checks the Indeed database for suitable candidates, checks of the candidates are already in our system, if so; it checks whether the candidates have not yet been commissioned, if so; it sends an automated message via WhatsApp / email if the candidate wants to work for your group, if not; it asks a Recruiter to send a message from the Indeed platform. The advantage for Clientis that we can scale up more than 35% faster because the robot takes over repetitive tasks."
329,"How are gathered data (KPI, financial) communicated to the client?","We see reports as a means and not as an end. We monitor the established (and standard) KPIs per customer, such as: • degree of the number of orders • degree of filling of vacancies • degree of mission interruptions • degree of absenteeism • quality level and evaluation at the end of the mission • occupational accidents We report on these KPIs during the consultation moments. This always goes in two ways; what is the number and what does the number say. What we mean by this is that it is good to report what the degree of fulfillment is, but it is more important to know why it changes, why it is different from other companies (or not) and what we can do about it together . Reports are based on a PowerPoint presentation per KPI: • Result KPI • Reason KPI • Improve action"
330,How does Gi Group accompany / guide the flexworker during his work?,"Thanks to our many years of experience, we know exactly what the temporary worker expects from us as an employer. Based on this knowledge, a guidance process has been developed in which the temporary worker is central. 1. Guidance during the induction process by the Consultant. 2. Contact moment at the end of the first working day and working week by the Consultant. 3. Check for need / motivation for training by the Consultant. 4. Monitoring progress during a training by Consultant. 5. Contact moment at the end of the trial period by the Consultant with the manager Client. 6. End of the first month of probation interview by Consultant. 7. Structured evaluation moments (every quarter) by the Consultant. 8. Compliance with the Client assessment system by Consultant. 9. Christmas gift and birthday card by the Consultant. 10. Employee satisfaction survey by the Consultant."
331,How do you register agreements made between Gi Group and the client?,The Service Level Agreement (SLA) is the most important document between Client and Gi Group and describes the cooperation and agreements between both parties. The purpose of an SLA is to make binding agreements about the quality parameters of the service and about the reports. The performance and services provided are continuously measured with Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that are defined in the SLA. We are happy to determine the content of this document together with Client.
332,Are exit interviews done by Gi Group?,"If a temporary worker or Gi Group decides to stop working, an exit interview will always take place. The results of an exit interview will be discussed with the relevant manager and included in the quarterly evaluation. Striking matters will also be directly fed back to HR. If a decision is taken by Client that the temporary worker must stop his activities, a reason will be issued from Client to Gi Group. Client must also adhere to the notice periods for termination of the assignment in the ABU CLA."
333,Can you describe your recruitment process?,"Even before recruitment starts, we start with proper preparation. This preparation is crucial in our operation to guarantee the correct quality afterwards. We first want to get to know you as well as possible. For this we work with various tools. On the one hand, we have our 'feel the job'. Here we let our dedicated consultant work on the shop floor for a (half) day to get to know the job, but also the surrounding culture, the team members, the atmosphere as well as possible. With this information, as well as on the basis of conversations with HR, people who exercise the position or a team leader, we draw up a ""Culture scan"". In this we ask ourselves questions such as: How do they work at Client, who works at Client, what makes someone fit for Client? In addition, we also prepare a ""Talent Scan"". This is our guide to selecting the right profile for a specific position. We assess both the hard facts, such as experience and skills, we take references where possible, but also the soft skills such as motivation, attitude, and does someone fit into the Client culture (checked in our ""Culture scan"") From this knowledge we start our search. We focus on looking for the right intake as well as actively looking for the right candidates on the market. We find it important in our search to always work from the right employer brand and to present our customer, Client, in the correct way. Each candidate goes through the following steps with us, in order to keep our quality high: CV screening + interview by phone, personal interview with consultant (during COVID only by phone), reference check, discussing vacancy and company. We believe it is important to treat our candidates as clients. We receive our candidate temporary employees at the office or at our client for a personal interview in which we elaborate on the previous points. In addition, we believe it is important to keep the ""customer experience"" of our candidate as high as possible. This also means that a candidate who is not selected for a vacancy at Client will receive constructive feedback as well as a number of other vacancies. In this way, our candidates maintain a positive feeling towards us as an office, as well as towards Client."
334,What contribution could you have to the employer branding of Client ?,"Our marketing specialists and your Onsite Consultant are happy to think along with Client  about employer branding. Nowadays, an employer branding strategy or no employer branding strategy makes the difference in a tight labor market, even now that more people are available due to the Corona pandemic. We see significant discrepancies in attracting and retaining talent between companies with a strong brand name, culture and large marketing budget and those that do not have this advantage. Together with Client  we make a SWOT analysis, in which the key points related to; “Why candidates would like to work at Client ” has been incorporated. We compare this SWOT analysis with a (local) competition analysis, after which we determine together which of the strengths we use in labor market communication, such as recruiting and SEO proof vacancy texts with an attractive layout, but also custom advertisements that we use via online - and offline channels. We also determine together with Client  which channel mix we will use. To arrive at a channel mix, we do AB tests, in which we try multiple channels and variants of advertisements, so that we can measure what gives the best results in the Franeker region. We always keep costs vs. the expected result sharp in the eye. Because we can analyze all data in Mysolution, our HR software, handy dashboards allow us to see which campaigns are most successful. After we have determined the employer branding strategy together with Client , we make an action plan and a schedule. Employer branding is a fixed item on the agenda below during our meetings. From our vision, employer branding can only be achieved if the internal organization supports this image and there is commitment at all levels; before and during the execution, both on the side of Client , and on the side of Gi Group. Communication of texts, images and videos are especially important during the recruitment and selection phase. But what was communicated during recruitment and selection must become apparent in reality during the introduction, the induction process, development and in the working environment at Client . External communication is about what, but especially how you communicate. The content must be consistent, honest and in line with the culture, target audience and predetermined message. In addition, the form also determines to a large extent how the message comes across. Who's speaking? What's the tone? How does it look? For example, do you want to position yourself as a young, innovative organization with a focus on fun? Then the communication must radiate this. Is development one of your spearheads? Then make sure that this is reflected again and again in your communication.  In addition, it is important to understand the candidates, so that together we can make Client  more interesting for them. Part of understanding the candidate is understanding where their interests lie. In addition, it is essential to look at where this specific group of candidates can be found, so on which platform. With this information, suitable vacancies can be written on the right platforms. Another possibility that Gi Group hopes to put into practice in the future at Client  is to make videos about the temporary workers who will start working at Client . This gives an idea of what a working day at Client  looks like. Interviews can also be held with the temporary workers, in which they can tell about their work experience and perception. Finally, we will look together at a content strategy and we can advise Client  on how smart more attention can be paid to increasing brand awareness on social media. Ultimately, we can only be successful in employer branding and marketing if our team can work closely with the team within Client  who is responsible for this."
335,How do you guarantee the quality and functioning of the temp workers?,"Recruitment • During the recruitment of flex workers, various steps have been built in to check the quality of the temporary worker in advance; • Telephone screening (availability, willingness to work shifts, motivation, certificates, language, etc.); • Reference check; • Face2face intake at location Client  by Onsite Consultant (deeper into competencies, shifts, motivation, culture match, general impression); • Conduct (language) tests or assessments for senior and office positions.During the recruitment of flex workers, various steps have been built in to check the quality of the temporary worker in advance: • Telephone screening (availability, willingness to work shifts, motivation, certificates, language, etc.); • Reference check; • Face2face intake at location Client  by Onsite Consultant (deeper into competencies, shifts, motivation, culture match, general impression); • Conduct (language) tests or assessments for senior and office positions.  Interim assesment  Interim assessment is always in consultation with the customer, as an assessment system has often already been set up. Gi Group's standard procedure is as follows: • Evaluation first day (by telephone by Onsite Consultant) • Evaluation first week (by phone by Onsite Consultant) • Evaluation first month (preferably on site by Onsite Consultant, if desired with the manager of the flex worker) • Evaluation after six months (on location by Onsite Consultant, preferably together with the flexworker's manager) • Annual evaluation (on location by Onsite Consultant, preferably together with the flexworker's manager) All assessments and communication are recorded in Mysolution, Gi Group's HR system.   Ongoing processes In addition to the formal evaluations, the Gi Group Onsite Consultant also regularly has an informal conversation with the managers and flex workers, so that any pain points are quickly identified. Our goal is to be on site as much as possible, especially during shift changes, so that we hit the people.  Training  Together with Client , we draw up a training plan per profile per person, whereby we will fully utilize the training reservation of 1.02% of the gross salary in phase A.  Reports In line with the agreed meeting structure, a report will be published in which the assessments are communicated. These reports also include details such as absenteeism, not showing up, arriving late, etc. We would like to talk to Client  about the requirements and wishes regarding this report."
336,How do you think you can spend the 1.02% training reservation for training at Client ?,"Schooling reservation for training is a very important ingredient to bind and captive flex workers. Specialized technical knowledge is a great addition to the production at Client . We propose to select flex workers together with Client  and to annually offer a group of outstanding people (as a guideline the aforementioned evaluations) a training course, for example Operator MBO 3, or another training that meets Client 's training needs. In doing so, the flex workers become more specialists, all-rounder deployable in the pool and Client  can offer them career opportunities, increasing the chance of Client  retaining these stars. Another group we can offer language training, safe working training, forklift or manager training. This is in consultation with Client  to give shape, whereby the outcome of the evaluations of the temporary workers also indicate a direction.  We can also use DOORZAAM schooling cheques. DOORZAAM's mission is to stimulate the sustainable employability of flex workers. Stimulating and promoting sustainable employability involves career, learning, development, health and finances. DOORZAAM distributes training vouchers to temporary employment organizations as a financial support for flex workers. The flex worker can use the voucher to choose one or more training courses, courses or training courses up to a maximum of € 500 incl. VAT. Upon receipt of these training vouchers, Gi Group will also make them available to flex workers deployed at Client . DOORZAAM: https://www.doorzaam.nl/loopbaan/scholingsvouchers/."
337,How do you feel about working with other parties? Do you think a supporting party needs a certain basic volume in order to function?,"Gi Group works in every role and in every construction, provided there are clear agreements, namely: • As a Single Supplier (standard model); • As a Co-Vendor together with other suppliers on the basis of equality (sometimes with a fixed share of hours and with a strong preference for direct account management); • As Master-Vendor with Co-Vendors who supply Gi Group; • As the only Co-Vendor where Gi Group supplies a Master Vendor."
338,"To what extent are you willing and able to handle the administrative processes around placement, planning, time processing and invoicing, via automated (linked) systems to expire (within the SETU standard)?","Our system Mysolution is the most advanced system for HR companies, especially in temping. All processes are centralized in one platform, so we can provide a full client- and candidate journey. We can connect almost every system with Mysolution. We also work with Nedap's PEP software. All Nedap PEP software is fully SETU grafted."
339,What year was your company founded?,Our company was founded in 1998
340,Do you provide transport?,"Regarding mobility for our people, we work together with a number of partners who provide us with the means of transport that are no older than 3 months and meet all set safety standards. We mainly opt for road transport by car, with a maximum of 4 people allowed in a car."
341,What posseblities and experience do you have with the training of forklift drivers and operators?,"The costs for lift, reach or narrow aisle truck training are fully covered by Gi Group from the budget of the 1.02% training reservation that we build up for flex workers in phase A (78 weeks). We train a large part of our logistics temporary workers through BLOM training courses. At the request of our client, this can of course also be done via another training institute in the Client region. Together with Client , we can select temporary workers and annually offer a group of excellence (as a guideline the aforementioned evaluations) training, for example Operator MBO 3. In doing so, they become more specialist and Client  can offer them career opportunities, thereby increasing the chance of retaining these excellence by Client . An example of a training that we regularly purchase for our customers in the production sector is:https://www.opleiding.nl/opleiding/mbo-vakopleiding-procesverbetering.html?open=brochure-lite&course=a9f3a7ac-78ba-4c8a-819e-42658a9b0f73  This training is at MBO-3 level, but shortened to the essential courses that are required for process operators and the costs are approximately € 2,630. A full MBO-3 training for process operator costs € 6,685. For the latter training it is a requirement that Client  is a recognized training company. We are happy to coordinate with Client  the exact percentage that Gi Group takes care of for this type of training, because this depends on how the total training budget is spent and for this we must first properly map out the volumes and wishes."
342,In what way and with what means do you guarantee optimal onboarding of new employees and what can this all include?,"Sales In our opinion, the design of the onboarding already starts with the start-up of a new customer. Sales has answered the questions from the customer during the commercial process and, together with operations, devised the solution in the form of related services. The agreements are laid down in an SLA and this is offset by a tariff. This information is entered by sales in Mysolution, our HR software, where the entire cycle of processes from inflow, throughflow to outflow and invoicing come together. Sales always remains closely involved during the implementation phase and works together with operations. Sales organizes a handover meeting, where all information is shared and discussed with colleagues from all departments such as; operation, recruitment, planning, finance and administration.  Recruitment Recruitment also plays an important role in informing flex workers, because recruitment establishes the first contacts with the prospective flex workers for Client . The recruiters must therefore be well informed about all the ins & outs at Client  and maintain short lines of communication with the Onsite Consultants.  CPA The administrative process is completely taken over by the Onsite Consultant by our CPA department, so that the Onsite Consultant can focus on account management and workforce management. CPA has no contact with the customer, but only with the flex workers. CPA takes care of all administrative matters concerning flex workers (hirer's remuneration, contracting, time processing, wage payments, corrections, leave, illness, etc.) and maintains the 1st line of communication with the flex workers. As a result, we deploy specialists in the administrative process, which reduces the error margins and the flex workers have quick answers to their questions. Before CPA can send a flex worker his or her employment contract for the digital signature, all mandatory and signed documents must be uploaded from the placement in the system and CPA must follow all instructions that we have specified specifically for Client  in Mysolution our HR -software. Think of things like; deposit forms, collective labor agreement, safety instructions, non-disclosure agreement, explanation, planning, time registration and company assets, such as shoes and clothing. We make a working-by-booklet especially for Client , in which the most important things are clearly described. The Onsite Consultant goes through this work-by-booklet extensively with the flex worker. These documents and instructions are easy to find for flex workers at any time via the online candidate portal, which is also accessible via an app. The safeguarding of all these process steps in Mysolution contributes to a positive experience for the flex worker of the onboarding.  Onsite operation In our opinion, nothing beats personal contact, so our Onsite Consultants are often on-site during the onboarding and induction period to inform, guide and answer questions for the flex workers. In this we always look for the triangle with production and HR of Client , because only together we can optimally fulfill this period of information and instruction."
343,What is your added value within Fashion & Luxury?,"We offer our clients a dedicated team of recruiters, who are highly skilled and specialized in the fashion and luxury sector, that can assist you with the following projects: • Finding the best candidates for In-Store roles and headquarter roles for  temporary staffing based on short term placements. • We use a business intelligence tool for insights in the local labor market, vacancies and competitors. • Finding the best candidates for In-Store roles and headquarter roles for temporary staffing based on a temping of secondment (fixed hours) concept. • Finding the best candidates for In-Store and head- quarter roles for permanent based on long-term placements. • We can accomplish a single assignment for 1 specific role or create a whole new team of several roles for new store openings. • In a partnership, we can spend time helping with branding and exposure to help stores on local level. • Free Consulting regarding recruitment processes and the market in local countries. • We have a wide variety of training options for Sales Advisors, Beauty Advisors or management training to Floor Managers, Assistant Store Manager and Store Managers. Together with Client, we draw up a training plan per profile/group, whereby we will make full use of the training reservation of 1.02% of the gross salary in phase A."
344,Could you get governmental funds and let the Client benefit from these subsidies / grants?,"We propose to distribute the following subsidies, which are paid out and apply to the population of flex workers who work at the Client 50/50 through Gi Group. The Client will then receive the 50% part of the subsidy after it has been paid to Gi Group.   Loonkostenvoordeel: • Rijksoverheid: https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/wet-tegemoetkomingen-loondomein-wtl/tegemoetkoming-loonkosten-oudere-jongere-of-gehandicapte-werknemers/loonkostenvoordelen-lkv   Lage inkomensvoordeel (LIV) • Rijksoverheid: https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/wet-tegemoetkomingen-loondomein-wtl/tegemoetkoming-loonkosten-oudere-jongere-of-gehandicapte-werknemers/lage-inkomensvoordeel-liv   Jeugd-LIV • Rijksoverheid: https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/wet-tegemoetkomingen-loondomein-wtl/tegemoetkoming-loonkosten-oudere-jongere-of-gehandicapte-werknemers/tegemoetkoming-verhoging-minimumjeugdloon-jeugd-liv"
345,Your organization provides continuity guarantees regarding (whether or not part-time) in-house occupancy and / or the local location. Explain how your organization deals with (guaranteed) qualitative and quantitative presence at the in-house and location.,"With a volume of 60,000 hours per year, converted 1,150 per week, Gi Group guarantees an in-house occupation of at least 2 days per week. Due to the flexibility in our model, we can easily adapt our in-house presence to the needs during peak times, during implementation and migration and during final selection interview rounds. Thanks to our onsite model with mobile consultants, who are supported and unburdened by the CRT, CPA the Flexpool Coordinators and our Staff departments, we are generally more present in-house than our competitors with a volume of 60,000 hours per year. The presence and occupation of the in-house office partly depends on the number of flex hours per week. If the number of hours falls below the number agreed in writing (60,000 hours / year), Gi Group reserves the right to adjust the daily staffing accordingly. We will involve Client  in the process of selecting a suitable in-house employee."
346,"Do you already have (potential) vendors in the region Friesland for more technical profiles, in case you will be rewarded as a Master Vendor?","Yes, we agree with this. Yes, we have both local partners and nationally operating partners. In the answer we primarily focus on our technical partners, as we expect to mainly need support from our partner database in the field of the heavier profiles, such as TD and experienced Operator. A selection of our technical partners: • Xelvin • Jobz-on • IJssel Technology • Techsharks • AB Vakwerk"
347,Does Gi Group has experience with managing Vendor as a Master Vendor?,"Yes, Gi Group is responsible for managing the sub-suppliers. In concrete terms, this means that we apply the same rates and conditions to the sub-suppliers, as agreed between Client  and Gi Group. Gi Group will also take care of all communication towards the sub-suppliers, about operational matters such as; vacancies, onboarding and planning, so that Client  only has one single point of contact, namely the Gi Group Onsite Consultant."
348,"Given the information in the introduction and your own knowledge of Client ; is the ""traditional"" in-house role necessary in your view? If not, how do you organize the necessary attention, if so how would you implement the in-house role? Which tasks, roles, activities contribute most to Client 's goals?","In our opinion, the onsite model is the only way to properly implement the HR partnership that Huhthamaki aspires to. Gi Group therefore does not have a branch network and is always onsite with its customers, whereby the onsite presence is linked to the hours per week. The close interdependence between the two organizations in the deployment of a large group of flex workers on the basis of posting in a so-called triangular employment relationship, combined with the requirements and wishes with regard to service provision from Client , means that regular but efficient communication is the only key to success. The Corona pandemic has taught the world to adapt to more remote communication through channels like; Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Skype for Business, etc. What has also become clear is that personal physical contact on the work floor is indispensable to strengthen a relationship and to arrive at creative solutions together.  However, these activities can easily be done from a distance, such as: • Search • Pre-selection • Assessments • Marketing • Administration  • Report • Planning and pool management • Replace no shows • Master Vendor service • Show up checks   Activities, where onsite presence is required, are:  • Implementation and migration • Final selection rounds • Introduction (onboarding, instructions) • Tours  • Company equipment; safety shoes, uniforms, PBM, access cards, etc. • Schooling  • Show up checks  • Evaluations and assessments  Work meetings (weekly, monthly, quarterly) We can also perform the above activities that are mentioned in the case of physical on-site presence, remotely. However, we strongly prefer to carry out these activities on-site with a physical presence."
349,"What percentage of your locations are company owned, franchised?",100% of our locations are company owned.
350,Is your company public or privately held?,Our company is privately held
351,Could you provide a list of your current (2018) 10 biggest international clients?,"Overview of our international the top 10 clients of Gi Group Holding in 2018: 1. BMW – 4.253 employees – 19 years 2. S.F. Express Group Corporation – 3.004 employees – 9 years 3. FIAT CHRYSLER AUTOMOBILES – 1.618 employees – 19 years 4.

352,Do you provide a general briefing regarding your onboarding proces and the way you prepare the temporary worker before the start of the assignment?,"Gi Group will use or compose information material that is made available for temporary workers that are assigned at Client. The responsibility of keeping this information material up-to-date lies with Client. Gi Group will always provide the latest version of the documents to the temporary workers. Information material and documents have to be approved by Client at all times, before being used operationally.  Gi Group is responsible for informing the temporary workers regarding the working environment at Client. Gi Group does this by handing out the brochure ""Working at Client"" and, if available, showing them a company video, in which Client describes all safety, HACCP, house rules etc.. In addition, we discuss and go through each job description separately per person.  The introduction program is always custom made and the level of unburdening is linked to the number of hours that Gi Group has at a specific site.  Some examples of on-boarding activities are: • Tour of the workplace by the onsite consultant ; • Provision of safety shoes; • Information on company rules and safety rules (signing); • Signing of health certificate, if applicable ; • Issue of tags and management of locker, if applicable; • Issue and/or discussion of an occupational health and safety (ARBO) checklist; • Discussing working hours and contacts/superior; • Designating how the candidate can be reached; • Policy on taking holidays/reservations; • Explanation of sickness absenteeism policy; • Briefing on health & safety instructions: practical information on the risks associated with the workplace; • Introduction of flexworker to Client mentor in accordance with the buddy system, if applicable; • Instruction on time recording; • Explanation of assessment system and career opportunities at Client; • Explanation of other documentation that the flexworker receives."
353,What performance metrics do you believe will help our companies be mutually successful?,"We look at KPIs tool and not as a goal. For each customer we monitor the agreed (and standard) KPIs and create a Service Level Agreement (SLA), in which we add the conditions for the standardization of our services. We report on these KPIs at regular consultation moments. We look at it in two ways; what is the number and what does the number say? Of course it is important to  report, for example, what the attrition rate is, but it is more important to know why it has changed, why it differs from other companies in the sector and region (or not) and what we can do about I together.  Examples of our used performance metrics are: fillrate (%), no-show, staff turnover/retention, response times, forecast to planning, customer satisfaction rate."
354,Do you have an escalation proces in place?,"We create an escalation matrix so that every escalation enters the correct level in both organizations and if it is not resolved within the specified time, it is raised one level from the first operational level to the level of management."
355,"What is your cancellation policy for temp assignements (""aanzegtermijnen)?","The client can only cancel a temporary worker within a reasonable time prior to the start of the assignment without payment. Of course, we would like to have an accurate forecast, because we assign resources of our recruitment department to the client.  When a temporary worker has started working, the actual worked hours have to be paid to the worker. This is the Dutch legislation. When a temporary worker attends at the site and it turns out, that there is no work available and the temporary workers is send home, the client has to pay 3 hours. When a temporary worker is assigned in a phase A agreement, the client can terminate the contract any time during the 78 weeks that phase A is applied. In the case of an agency work employment contract with agency clause, the private employment agency shall notify the temporary worker in good time about the approaching expiry of the temporary work employment contract, so that the temporary  worker can make preparations, taking into account the following period of notice: CHECK WITH NEW LEGISLATION: Duration of placement in worked weeks Period of notice in calendar days. • 0 to 12 weeks 0 • 12 to 26 weeks 5 • 26 to 52 weeks 10 • 52 up to and including 78 weeks 14"
356,What is your procedure for auditing and approving the hours worked?,"Administrative organization is the basis of our service to the client. After all, a simple, error-free, accurate administrative process yields efficiency, timesaving’s and insight. Our main administrative processes are; time registration, hour processing, remuneration, contracting, invoicing and reporting. We have decided to mostly centralize, automate and digitize our administrative processes in one platform Mysolution. In order to guarantee the quality and continuity of the administration our Central Admin Team (CAT) takes care of the administration for our temporary employees and clients working from our head office. The Consultants are thereby relieved and can occupy themselves with what really matters; our temporary workers and our clients.  Our back office system is also integrated in Mysolution. Mysolution is specially made for staffing agencies, secondment agencies and payrollers, so that the ABU Collective Labour Agreement, hirer's remuneration (‘inlenersbeloning), the ‘Arbeidstijdenwet’ and other Dutch laws and regulations are applied optimally. Nocore provides our customers and temporary workers with smart Portals and useful Apps.  Besides our Consultants, the Central Administration Team also works in Mysolution. This team processes all hours of temporary workers, including changes, holiday requests etc. The Central Administration Team also generates and manages all the contracts and dossiers for temporary workers. When it comes to hour tracking and time registration for the client we offer three options: - Web Portal: Temporary workers register their worked hours via our Web Portal, after which the manager of the the client approves the hours. Gi Group does a final check, after which the hours are exported into our back office system. - Excel file: Our back office system is able to digitally receive and read an Excel dump (in a fixed format) made by the client or generated by a time registration tool. This process is completely automated, so takes less time for both Gi Group and the client. - PEP-reader: For logistics and production environments, we use Nedap's PEP reader, a time registration system. When using the PEP reader, the temporary worker clocks in on arrival, at the end of the working day he clocks out again. The hours are thus real time in the the client's system. After approval, Gi Group does a final check, after which the hours are exported to our back office system."
357,"Define the transition and migration plan (SMART). Mention the critical factors, possible risks and risk-mitigation steps per site. Besides that, describe which information you need from the Client in order to execute the transition and migration plan. Define which migration period (duration) would be feasible for you.","At Gi Group, we have an international standard as it comes to implementing. In each country, we have a similar way of handling this process, adjusted to the local needs. This process consists out of nine mayor steps, which we can conclude in 40 days or less. Our implementation plan goes in more detail and the mayor steps, slightly different grouped, fall in minor steps. Lesson’s learned concerning transition and migration: • 99% of the temporary workers goes along with the transition to a new supplier; • After the takeover term (1.040 hours is industry standard) temps can always be migrated free of charge from incumbent suppliers; • Partnership, communication, lean/clear process and project management are key for success; • Gi Group coordinates and unburdens the client optimally during the entire transition and migration process; • We guarantee the client a smooth migration, so that client's organisation and its customers do not notice it; • Reservations of the temporary workers, like holidays and holiday money, are paid out when they are migrated. This is the Dutch law. • Preparing a 'buffer' of temporary workers prior to the migration is smart (often proves to be unnecessary). We have developed the implementation and migration process systematically and always work with a detailed action plan and planning. With this, we guarantee a flawless and smooth execution together with the client. Gi Group has a lot of experience with implementations and migrations. If desired, we have clients within the same sector, with similar profiles and a comparable number of hours, who want to act as a referent towards the client. Before we start the implementation phase, sales will gather all needed information in an inventory document. This covers the information for our departments; finance, administration, recruitment and operations. Operations takes the lead when the implementation phase starts and will complete or adjust this inventory file during the implementation process.  We attached another important document, namely the migration document that needs to be filled-out by the incumbent suppliers."

361,Could you give a general discription of Gi Group Holding International?,"Over the years, the Group has changed from being a local temporary labor provider to a global provider, with a diversified range of HR solutions and geographical markets.   Having invested in the past years to consolidate its presence worldwide, Gi Group is now ready to benefit from sales growth that will lead to margin increase in the countries where Gi Group has a longstanding presence. The route to achieving Group’s purposes requires significant expansion investment, which started in the previous decade, to implement the Group’s commercial strategy, which sets out: • the Group’s presence in new markets, through acquisitions or opening start-ups directly; • expanded geographic coverage, by opening new branches; • supported growth, in terms of volumes and market share; • consolidated Group presence in some markets, also through acquisitions (to increase market share or to start new business lines); • increased value proposition for customers, by starting new business lines thanks to synergies generated by an already existing organization; • business models, processes, systems, in general, all the infrastructure necessary to organize the Group’s activities under one global image, “One Company”. The activities, economics and strategies connected to some relevant Countries are described in the following paragraphs aimed at showing the Group’s trend of the last two Years (figures FY 2020 are provisional). Gi Group Netherlands is the employment agency in Netherlands, operating since 2015 and it had a trend of growth in commercial Temporary and Permanent Search and Selection activities.  The focus on large corporate customers has led to satisfying results, particularly in terms of volumes in the logistics division. Activities have been diversified and Gi Group has started to provide assistance to Contact Centre customers on a large scale.  In 2019, new business services were offered under the Grafton brand, with particular emphasis on the Finance & Accounting, Logistic & Supply Chain, Office & HR, Sales & Marketing and IT sectors, and new Search and Selection businesses were approached. In 2020 we onboarded mainly new customers. Working in the new world effected by Covid we adopted our methods and structure slightly, but the already strategy of centralisation and digitalization were a good base to start on. Despite Covid we doubled our activities in The Netherlands during 2020. We also strengthen our national footprint and innovated our HR solutions, as well in regard to the new legislation (WAB) that is applicable from January, 1st 2020, as from an IT client value perspective.  During the financial year, the existing Gi Group company changed its name to Gi Group Temp, to dedicate itself completely to Temporary Staffing, and the Group has established 2 new companies dedicated to Permanent Staffing and Freelancing businesses. The three companies have been brought together under Gi Group Holding B.V., the newly-formed Dutch holding company.   Various objectives were fixed: • to develop the Temporary Staffing business, • to generate profitability via Specialist Recruitment activities under the Grafton brand and in the Fashion & Luxury sector, • to begin an international mobility program in support of Temporary Staffing activities,  In 2019 Gi Group Netherlands revenues totalled +93,7% compared to FY 2018 and an increase also in figures 2020: +97,7% towards FY 2019.   Gi Group has a global vision of the development of the market: • We aim to act as an innovative response to Corporate companies (multinationals with a large presence on a global scale), • Gi Group's focus is on the need to combine service and competitiveness with solutions able to intercept the needs of the market - in this phase of the increasingly candidate-driven world economy - through strategies in concert with the client, that take into consideration the demands coming from the increasingly magmatic labor market.  In 2019 Group revenues totalled +13.1% compared to FY 2018 and it is forecasted for 2020 the same volumes of revenues of the previous year even if we had to manage the pandemic at ww level.   This projection confirms the positive evolution for the Group in terms of organic growth in Italy and abroad. The increase in economics involves not only volumes but also profitability: Gross Profit growth is driven by top-line increase and slight improvement of margins. We report below the table with Group worldwide highlights.  EBITDA at global level in 2020 was +59,4 mln€. Thousand Eur  2019 2020 Revenues 2.567.554 2.522.753 Gross profit 330.634 308.062 GP % on REV 12,88% 12,21%  The soundness of the financial structure of the Group is another important measure of evaluation: despite the investment policy, the Group applies a prudent financial management strategy, granting an adequate level of cash & cash equivalents and the availability of sources of borrowings via an adequate quantity of credit lines and through the factoring usage. The Group increased the ratio between medium and long-term investments and the total debt, supporting investment and business development plans. Financial interlocutors are mainly chosen if they have a high credit standing and by limiting the concentration of exposure to such institutions.  In the coming years, the Group intends to pursue this growth strategy: a commercial product line which is ever more aimed at the verticalisation and diversification of solutions, assessing acquisitions in strategic countries, with the objective of widening our global presence."
362,Does Gi Group have a G-account?,Gi Group Netherlands has a G-account and can use this if required. We are also SNA-certified and ABU member and therfor are reguarly audited. These and aditional certifications compel us to be a trustworthy partner when it comes to payment and make the use of a G-account not mandatory.
363,"How does Gi Group register leave, absence and holidays of the temporary worker?","Leave, absence and holidays of the temporary worker are first communicated after consultation with the client by our Central Admin Team (CAT)."
364,What is your mission statement?,"As a global player we want to contribute to the evolution of the labor market through our services and emphasize on the personal and social value of work"". Our core values is embedded in our DNA:  • Work • Responsibiliy  • Care • Economic Efficiency • Continious Learning and Innovation • Team Spirit"
365,Can you describe your process of planning in practice?,"The success factors for making and executing the planning and pool management are communication (both to each other and to the internal organization, co-supplier and flex workers), and the planning tool • 5 days before the schedule is released, the team leaders have access. They must have entered the changes 2 days before the planning is due (think of dividing services, competences and positions according to your own wishes); • 4 days in advance we send out the planning for the following week; • The team leaders can always see in real time what is happening in the planning. So when we make a proposal for a change, the team leaders watch. We all see one schedule; • We distinguish two phases in our planning tool, namely proposal planning and actual planning; • After changes, we consult with the team leaders and they can refute changes within 24 hours. In short, we always keep in touch with the team leaders; • For each department, we schedule a short operational meeting with the team leaders once a week to discuss the changes; • The flex workers receive an email or text message with the services (in coordination with Client e-Commerce); • Pool management is organized on the basis of functions and availability; • Planning is organized on the basis of departments, teams, positions and competences. • Each flex worker receives 9 shifts per 2 weeks, which is an average of 35 hours per week. An extra shift must be requested when planning via the flex worker portal."
366,How is the availability organised for the client?,"We work with our onsite team in shifted shifts between 06:00 and 22:00 and work between 22:00 and 06:00 and with consignment shifts on weekends. As a result, we guarantee 100% accessibility for Clientand our flex workers. As mentioned earlier, we have a Back up in the Back up Team for every position. In an emergency, they will intervene in the consignment services and on-site staffing. The Caretakers are always available 24/7 for our EU flex workers. They will also work in shifts, so that there is an eye for the human side and their private life. Our CAT (Central Administration Team) is available during office hours."
367,How can you support and advise the client in other ways?,"The Mysolution planning tool takes into account the applicable collective labor agreement, the Working Hours Act and other laws and regulations. Within the frameworks set by Client e-Commerce, flex employees have the option of self-rostering via PC, tablet and smartphone, with the 24/7 app, in the event of ad-hoc changes. If something changes in one timetable, the other timetables will automatically adjust accordingly. Gi Group advises Clienton planning and pool management on matters such as: • Where are the bottlenecks? • Where and when is cross training or training necessary? • When should recruitment start in order to anticipate peaks in time? • How can we improve forecasting together? (based on history) • What is the optimal pile composition and size? • Which mix of target groups works best per profile and / or department?"
368,Can you describe your escalation model?,"Gi Group uses a communication matrix defined at the beginning of the collaboration. In addition, service reviews are held at least once a month. This is also used to check the KPIs and alignment to Service level Agreement. In the figure to the right, we have define the process, when dealing with and escalation.   In principle, all points of the escalation are processed in level 1 or 2. If there is no solution, the persons involved coordinate the integration of further necessary responsible persons. We offer the Client directly a Senior Account Manager. TheSenior Account Manager is not in the operational line, but works from a helicopter view and acts from Gi Group Holding across the departments and brands. During the implementation phase, he or she will work closely with the Corporate Sales Manager, who takes the lead during the commercial process and therefore knows well what we have agreed and offered."
369,What kind of services does Gi Group provide to ensure quality by using KPI's?,"Services  In order to offer Clientthe region the desired service, we have determined a team composition and working method, partly on the basis of the information obtained. Mutual trust and the common goal to achieve the KPIs are central to this. The KPIs are a guideline and a compass for good performance, but in the end it is all about Client bringing in and retaining motivated people, with the right mindset. In addition to the hard KPI set, we also focus on the soft criteria to be able to meet the assignment. These two elements; KPIs on the one hand and people's motivation and mindset on the other are closely intertwined. Clienthas recorded many processes in the Flex Handbook, Gi Group will fully conform to this. That is the reason that a number of matters are not discussed in more detail in our action plan, such as consultation structure or KPIs. We see KPIs as part of the toolkit to make increasingly smarter choices together, to keep each other sharp and as indicators to learn from or to identify. From our system, we are able to monitor a set of KPIs digitally and in real-time by means of clear dashboards, which can be fully adapted to the KPI set of Client. Via web portals Client's stakeholders have access to this dashboard, so that the Excel format, which is now used by Client, no longer has to be manually updated."
370,How does Gi Group manage upscaling?,"If we have to scale up to 10%, we do this by increasing the capacity on recruitment or we choose to have every flex worker who wishes this work an extra shift within 2 weeks. So instead of running 9 shifts, running 10 shifts and rewarding the flex worker. All laws and regulations are always taken into account. The planning tool is designed for this."
371,How are holiday requests managed?,"Holiday requests must be requested at least 4 weeks in advance via the employee portal. You can easily submit the application in the flex worker portal. Within 3 working days, the flex worker will receive a response with any explanation. This is managed by our by Central Admin Team (CAT)."
372,Can you describe your ramp-up process in a new site? Please focus on timing and non-disruption for Client activities.,"At Gi Group, we have an international standard as it comes to implementing. In each country, we have a similar way of handling this process, adjusted to the local needs. We fully master the implementation and migration process, because we have done it numerous times. We have every detail written-out in detail in flow-charts, systematically. The main goal is that the temporary workers and Client are fully unburdened and facilitated by Gi Group, so that the implementation and migration goes flawless and without disturbances.  Normally we need about 30-60 days to implement a new site. The exact timeline depends on four elements: 1. Do we need to migrate the temporary workers from the incumbent supplier(s), towards Gi Group? If the answer is yes, how many temporary workers are we talking about? 2. What is the number of temporary workers we need to recruit for Client, based on the rolling forecast? 3. What is the level of complexity of the processes at the Client site, which we need to take into account? 4. What is the level of complexity of the services (for example; testing, planning, pool management, on-boarding, vendor management etc.) that need to implement for Client?"
373,Could you describe your communication matrix?,"We will determine the definitive communication structure and agenda topics together with Client. Our mind-set is always proactive, sharp and focused on optimization and improvement. It starts with listening carefully, meeting expectations, follow-up actions points and mutual agreements.  All requests and questions are centralized through  the onsite consultant, the Single Point of Contact (SpoC), who dispatches the questions and follows up Client’s requests and questions which are managed on 3 different communication levels:  Operational level (Onsite Operations) Frequency: daily / weekly • Operations • Forecast planning • Starts and stops temporary workers • Pool management • Recruitment campaigns • Issues  Tactical level ((Client Management – Account Team): Frequency: 6 times a year • KPIs and performance Gi Group • Mid-long term planning • Developments of the labour market • Process improvement • Escalations  Strategic level (C-level) Frequency: 2 times a year • KPIs and performance Gi Group • Developments within Client • Developments within and from Gi Group • Developments of the labour market • Innovation proposals • Contract modifications"
374,What are your credentials in the Transportation and Logistics business?,"Gi Group Netherlands is specialized in logistic customers. Approximately 80% of our revenu comes from logistic clients. Our model is build around corporate customers, with a high demand in terms of volume. Over the years Gi Group has developed a  deep knowledge of the logistic sector. Our core profiles are; logistic worker, driver license-B, forklift driver, reachlift driver, production worker and operator."
375,How can Gi Group support the client with cost savings?,"The biggest direct cost saving by far is generated by the migration of the temporary workers, from the incumbent supplier(s), towards Gi Group against a strong reduced migration multiplier for all profiles. The magnitude of this cost saving is easy to calculate by the client.  If the client is doing the planning and pool management itself, we estimate the saving we can generate from planning and pool management is somewhere between 5% – 10% of the total spend of hours within this part. When it comes to cost saving, Gi Group works from the principle of Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). We developed a model for TCO that enables us to analyse our client’s core processes and filter and reduce or eliminate bottlenecks.   We also perform a Fresh Eyes Review every 18 months, to stay sharp and proactive in the cooperation with the client. Because the actual DNA of Gi Group was created after the takeover of Worknet, the onsite internal staffing agency of FIAT CHRYSLER AUTOMOBILES, our culture is lean from the start. Experience with manufacturing companies teaches us that we can divide cost savings in two groups:  1. Core processes: 90% of cost savings can be realized in direct costs for example reduce number of hours and supplementary hours by planning and pool management, onetime cost saving through migration of the current flex workers against a payroll multiplier and reduce absence and now show rates by introducing loyalty incentives and training programmes for temporary workers. 2. Non-Core processes: about 10% of cost savings can be realized in indirect costs. The Master Vendor model is well equipped to generate cost savings in these non-core processes.  From our work ethics and DNA we find it important to: • Work from the principle of the DMAIC cycle from (Lean) Six Sigma; • Involve Gi Group colleagues from other countries, to actively share their knowledge and experience; • Involve the client’s employees from other locations / countries, to actively share their knowledge and experience. For the cost saving in the field of non-core processes, mentioned in group 2, we propose to implement a Master Vendor model. Implementing a master vendor generates savings in the fields of: • Contract Management (co-vendors) • Workforce Management (temporary workers) • Planning en pool management • Hour tracking (one flow) • Invoicing (one flow)"
376,Could you describe the proces of pre-selection during recruitment?,"Pre-selection of candidates is centraly organised and is being performed by our Central Recruitment Team. This means our Onsite Consultant only receives CV's of candidates which already match the hard- and soft factors the client demands. This contributes to operational efficiency. Previous to the pre-selection Gi Group and the client determine the generic and specific requirements regarding the selection. The hard facts (salary, certification, distance, language, transportation, flexibility, availability, experience) are discussed between the recruiter and the candidate. Apart from that we look for candidates matchin with the client's culture and values. Through this procedure we guarantee a 100% match on hard and soft facts , through which the candidate quickly finds his/her way regarding tasks, procedures and culture and will therefor quickly be productive. Through interviews we gather information on behaviour, knowlegde and certain competences which need to be developed. If required we can complement the selection process with an assessment or skilltest."
377,What does your service model look like?,"We designed our temping service model around our logistic clients and made it very efficient and scalable, because we centralized all tasks that allow themselves to be centralized, by running the departments: • Central Recruitment Team: sourcing, screening, selecting, reference checks, plan the interviews for the On-Site team; • Central Admin Team: salary payment, 1st line for questions, sickness, leave, contracting, hour processing, audits; • Central Planning Team: planning (closely with the On-Site team), no show replacement. Our On-Site team consists of On-Site Managers (we call them Onsite Consultants), that are fully focused on Workforce Management and Account management, because the other tasks are being done by the centralized divisions. Besides this, we work with Shift Supervisors (we call them Caretakers), that manage most of the operational tasks during shifts on the work floor."
378,What are your unique capabilities?,o Data driven organization; o Balanced workforce mix between locals and people from a wide range of other countries; o Partnership for full HR cycle.
379,What recruitment channels do you use for personel in the beauty and fashion industry?,"• Job boards; We have accounts on multiple platforms and job crawlers. • LinkedIn; Using Job slots and our recruiting sheets for pro-active hunting. • Social Media; We use Instagram ads and Facebook ads. Also: posting and sharing the vacancies in the hot Facebook groups related to Fashion, Beauty, Retail and Jobs. • Store to Store Hunting & Mystery shopping; We take the time to approach good candidates in stores and convince them to work for Client and do mystery shopping to test the potential candidates we have in mind. • Our Network; We have a very big network. Our Fashion & Luxury recruiters focus on creating a network of people who are working in the Fashion & Luxury industry. • Interviews; We are very flexible to do our interviews throughout the country. We can operate from every city in the country. • Competence Ranker; We ask which competences Client finds important. We will do our interview based on these competences through our STAR-technique."
380,Do you provide health insurance for cross-border temps?,"Every labor migrant receives standard health insurance from us. We arrange this with Hollandzorg. If an employee wishes to opt out of this, this must be indicated to us in writing."
381,"Could you indicate how long the implementation will take, what the costs are and what in your opinion is important for a succesful implementation?","Implementations with the scale of Client  take a maximum of 8 weeks, but practice shows that we often finish most of the work in 4 to 6 weeks.  In our opinion, a successful implementation / migration consists of 6 elements: 1. Before we start implementing, invest a lot of time in building a relationship with the operational teams of the Plants of Client , so that we understand each other well and discuss in detail what the plan of action will be. As far as we are concerned, the key lies in the trust from the Plants; 2. A qualitative implementation team, composed of experienced professionals (at all levels), with a lot of implementation (migration) knowledge and experience; 3. A Gi Group implementation team that is already involved during the RFQ, so understands the expectations, wishes and requirements of Client ; 4. Freeing up extra resources during the implementation (migration), so that we always have enough people to complete this process on time and properly; 5. Thorough preparation, planning, control and implementation; 6. ""Cooperate"" in advance as a flex worker in the departments, so that the on-site teams understand the operational activities and requirements at Client  well; 7. A phased implementation, taking into account the peaks of Client , retains a stable flex pool of the current suppliers, roll-out per Plant (eg starting with one Plant and using this as a positive example to other Plants).  What we expect from Client  is: - Good communication - Support and involvement at all levels, in particular with operations on the Plants - Insight into stakeholders"
382,What happens after the implementation fase?,"Even after the implementation phase, we will be more than usual on-site on location at fixed times, so that the flex workers can contact us with all their questions and we will handle this for Client . Personal contact is the key to this. During the first few weeks, we regularly check per person whether everything is going well with the salary and whether everything is clear with regard to the candidate portal and candidate file. We also put the implementation and migration, the first two months, on the agenda of the regular consultation moments with Client  as standard. In addition, flex workers can always call our CPA department, which is specially designed to answer first-line questions from flex workers. The back office specialists know the ins and outs when it comes to remuneration, legislation and regulations and the application of the hirer's remuneration at Client , so they quickly remove any ambiguity."
383,What are your expectations from the customer during the implementation and migration fase?,"The starting point is that we relieve Client  as much as possible during the implementation and migration and ensure that everything runs smoothly. Client  must be able to continue to focus fully on the core activity, namely producing the product and for the flex workers, only the logo above the salary slip must change and the rest remain the same and familiar. The expectations in the form of actions can be found in the schedule under point 1. Gi Group also provides Client  with a complete package, including all documentation for the releasing party, information sheets, FAQ, presentations for the kick-off meetings. and information sessions with flex workers, but also action and decision lists, etc. are ready to use. Thanks to our extensive experience with implementations and migrations of groups of tens to hundreds of flex workers, your implementation is in good hands at Gi Group. That's a promise."
384,How is the onsite recruitment organised in combination with cross-border channels?,"Gi Group has arranged its recruitment on-site for Clientand focused on customer level. Gi Group has an Onsite Recruitment Team (ORT). This is a centralized and specialized recruitment team of specific size, based on the location of the customer. The ORT enables us to scale up and down very quickly at the location of our client, because the Recruiters have a customer focus. The ORT is responsible, among other things, for recruitment, pre-selection, reference checks, talent pool management, possibly planning face-to-face conversations and coordinating the activities of the new arrivals on location. The ORT has the latest IT applications and, in addition to the traditional telephone line, also makes extensive use of WhatsApp (messages / video), SMS, Facebook and FaceTime. The ORT can also use both online and offline channels. More details about the online channels and recruitment tools can be found in the chapter Innovation. Online channels include social media such as; Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn, but also channels such as www.gigroup.nl, Google Adds and our own database. In addition, job boards are also used. These are digital boards on which vacancies and CVs are published, for example Indeed, Neuvoo, Nationale Vacaturebank, Werk.nl and regional platforms. Offline channels are also actively used in campaigns. There are many ways to search for suitable candidates for a vacancy offline. For example, flyers are hung up and distributed around business parks, public buildings and supermarkets in the vicinity of the region. Vacancies are also published in local newspapers and referral campaigns are used (for example tell-a-friend promotions with a reward). When people receive recommendations from people they trust, they are more likely to take the step and continue. In addition to our own Gi Group offices, we also use partners for recruitment abroad (8 countries) for EU flex workers."
385,How is absence managed?,"In the event of absence, a flex worker must notify us at least 3 hours prior to the start of the shift. This must be done by e-mail and the flex worker must be available by telephone. This is managed by by our Central Admin Team (CAT)."
386,Can you describe the administrative proces for temporary workers?,"CAT The administrative process is completely taken over from the on-site team by our CAT (Central Administration Team) department, so that the on-site team can focus on account management and workforce management. The CAT customers are our flex workers. The CAT arranges all administrative matters concerning flex workers (hirer's remuneration, contracts, time processing, wage payments, corrections, leave, illness, etc.) and maintains 1st-line contact with flex workers. In addition, the CAT ensures compliance with legislation, collective labor agreements, audits (SNA, NeN and ABU) and the guidelines of Client. Specialists who focus on our administrative process work at the CAT, thereby reducing errors. Our specialism enables us to provide quick and effective answers to questions from our flex workers. Before the CAT can send a flex worker his or her employment contract for the digital signature, all mandatory and signed documents must be uploaded from the placement in the system. The CAT follows the process that we have set up especially for Clientand is fully implemented in our HR software system Mysolution. This includes matters such as: resources issue forms, collective labor agreement, safety instructions, non-disclosure agreement, explanation of the portal and explanation of the planning and time registration. The documents and instructions are available to the flex worker at any time via the online candidate portal, which is also accessible via an app. The safeguarding of all these process steps in Mysolution contributes to a positive experience for the flex worker regarding good employment practices from Gi Group."
387,Can you desribe retention within Gi Group?,"Retention  Labor is human work. By giving flex workers the right attention, turnover, absenteeism and no show are reduced and involvement is increased. By creating a sustainable retention plan, we ensure that flex workers have and keep a bond with Clientand Gi Group. Focus on a longer stay, with 40 weeks becoming the norm instead of the current average of 34 weeks. That is our common goal. After the correct match, the guidance of the flex worker begins. The EU flex workers are welcomed upon arrival by a Caretaker who assigns them a room and offers a thorough welcome and bedding package containing: • New blankets • Two new sets of pillowcases and bottom sheets • A new pillow • An alarm clock with battery • Work shoes • T-shirts The Caretaker ensures that the EU flex workers feel at home in their new home and shows them the way around them. On the first working day, the on-site team will introduce themselves and the buddy will go through the training process with the support of the team leader in accordance with the Client guidelines. The flex workers receive an explanation about the Gi Group working method and portal and, in addition to the culture of Client e-Commerce, are also informed about the culture and standards of Gi Group. Of course we adhere to the guidelines from the Flex manual and the documentation of Client e-Commerce. We focus on satisfaction because: • Gi Group is the official employer and attaches importance to satisfied flex workers; • A satisfied flex worker likes to go to work; • A satisfied flex worker performs better; • A satisfied flex worker is not very absent and stays longer at Client e-Commerce. The Gi Group Onsite Manager, together with the Flex Team Lead and buddies, is responsible for guiding flex workers on the work floor. Based on this knowledge, a guidance process has been developed in which the flex worker is central.   Our method of binding and retaining flex workers for Clientconsists of: • Maintain as much contact as possible with the flex workers and know what is going on. This in a smart mix of as much presence as possible, attention from the Caretaker and diversity in contact across modern online channels; • Streamlined onboarding; in which we offer clarity and structure in addition to a warm welcome; • Offer good housing with the possibility of private living; we do the same with transport; • Guidance for EU flex workers in applying for their BSN and bank account number; • Guiding any doctor, dentist or hospital visits; • Extra personal guidance during the arrival and training period • Extra attention around public holidays and holiday periods in connection with a higher risk of outflow; • Contact moment from Recruiter / Planner at the end of the first working day and first working week; • Providing Dutch language training from Shopper B and extra stimulation at Shopper C; • Show appreciation by means of Christmas gift, birthday card and reward for extra effort; • Conducting structural employee satisfaction surveys and acting appropriately on the results."
388,Do you have a covid-19 protocol?,"We have a comprehensive covid-19 protocol, in which we have described per process step which instructions, tools, reports, form and rules apply. This is especially crucial for cross-border temp workers because they live and travel together. We have separate quarantine housing, where we can isolate people. We can provide a more detailed description if needed."
389,Could you explain how you will do the planning and the management of the pool of beauty advisors?,"The success factors for making and executing the planning and poolmanagement are always communication and the planning tool; communication towards each other, towards the internal organization and towards the Beauty Advisors. The Retail Managers will have their own access to the portal, so they can always see in real-time what is happening in the planning, so when we make a proposal for a change in the planning, the Retail Managers will see the change. Also the replacements of Beauty Advisors due to sickness or other reasons are facilitated by the system, because the poolmanagement functionality is integrated and highly automated. Of course, the personal contact between the Beauty Advisors and our Flexpool Coordinators is still mandatory to check the daily presence, make agreements and confirm shifts.  We stay in personal touch with the Beauty Advisors in the pool by telephone, WhatsApp, SMS, Socials or other popular channels through a fixed schedule. We also send out automated, but personalized messages at important moments such as birthdays, graduation and new year transition. The aim is to maintain the pool. The options for retaining this target group can also include a reward system that can be saved for something per hour worked. This will certainly ensure maintenance of the pool during a low season.  Our Flexpool Coordinators, that take care of planning and poolmanagement, work in shifts, 7 days a week and are also reachable after office hours. Besides the extra service our Flexpool Coordinators already cover, our portal also offers a 1st line self-support as an IT solution between 22:00 and 06:00. The self-support functionality meets the replacement demand, by automatically sending a message to the reserve pool of candidates, allowing available flex workers to schedule themselves to fill the shift. Thanks to this automated smart tooling, any other candidates who have also responded will be unsubscribed and the shift will be confirmed to the flex worker who acted the fastest. The system rewards the most flexible flex workers. A lot is possible in the field of rewarding the Beauty Advisors in the pool, but we are happy to discuss this in person with Client."
390,Could you please describe your recruitment channels you common use?,"Some of the channels we common use are:  • Social media – We invest heavily in paid social media marketing campaigns. The social channels that we use most at this point are; Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and LinkedIn. • Gi Group database – We have a unique candidate database that our Consultants work with on a daily basis. Our database offers advanced possibilities to reach groups of candidates that match a vacancy on an efficient way. It is possible to select CV’s by criteria such as place of residence, availability, work experience, education, salary request and keywords. Thanks to these advanced options, we can send targeted mailings to relevant candidates for Client vacancies. Of course we apply the new legislation regarding AWR and GDPR on our database. • www.gigroup.nl  – Through our website we reach a large number of unique visitors and applicants. Candidates find us via search engines; organic or, for example, through AdWords campaigns on Google.  • Jobboards / Job crawlers – For the profiles of our clients, we place vacancies on national and regional job boards and job crawlers like Indeed and Neuvoo. We know exactly which job boards yield the best results for each target group. • Offline – Because the focus of most companies is online, we also use smart offline campaigns to recruit for our customers. Think about flyer actions, billboards or referral actions. By rewarding temps with an interesting amount of money for supplying new employees and by rewarding job-seekers with gift vouchers for supplying new employees, we are able to meet an extensive part of our recruitment needs. • Google for Jobs – Since 2019 the online job market is disrupted by internet giants. Companies, job boards and staffing agencies, for the time being can continue to occupy the top positions in Google with good Search Engine Optimization (SEO) or a large Google AdWords budget (SEA). However, with Google for Jobs the cards are shuffled again. Those who were too late for strong SEO and SEA now get new opportunities with Google for Jobs."
391,What is your incentive/reward program to recruit workers during peak season?,"During peak season, we use extra resources to support the recruitment of the required high amounts of temporary workers:  • We use referral as a recruitment channel. We award our candidates with incentives in the form of value coupons during our tell-a-friend referral recruitment actions; • Gi Group can also pay the temporary workers who stay on-board until the end of the peak season, a retention fee of €250, -. Gi Group will pay out this fee to the temporary workers and will charge the Client only a net retention fee; • Extra Pull actions and media, based on customized marketing campaigns; • Focus on students as this population is willing to work only for a short period of time, fast deployable and flexible so therefore perfect candidates for short peak periods."
392,Could you describe your customer satisfaction feedback mechanisms?,"We have the opinion that personal contact is key. We invest in our consultants and believe they should be able to make the difference for Client. Our main feedback channel is via them. Besides that on each level formal and informal moments are in place to get feedback from Client. And by the way, we give it too.  Finally we participate in the global and provide local customer satisfaction surveys."
393,Describe your strategies for retaining your temporary workforce,"Through our years of experience, we know exactly what the temporary worker expects from us as an employer. Based on this knowledge, an accompanying guidance process is been developed in which the temporary worker always is in the centre of attention: 1. Guidance during the induction period; 2. Contact moment at the end of the first working day and working week; 3. Check on needs and motivation for training & schooling; 4. Monitoring the progress and progress during training & schooling; 5. Contact moment at the end of the probationary period; 6. End of the first month probation interview; 7. Structured evaluation moments (every quarter); 8. Compliance with the Valeant evaluation methodology; 9. Christmas gift and birthday card; 10. Employees’ satisfaction survey."
394,How could you work together with Client to reduce costs for both parties?,"We will work with Client Key Stakeholders to evaluate the existing processes to identify areas cost savings.  Gi Group´s Quality and Innovation review is designed to improve process efficiencies leading to financial savings.  These savings include time and money spent on recruiting and training new starters through attrition, reviewing shift patterns to reduce costs, improving productivity etc.  Our top saving drivers are: Time-to-fill; Range and experience of Candidates needed at each period; Workers productivity; Communication and Operational Process; Training Programs opportunities and Our IT collaboration tools. Furthemore our Dedicated Account Team – guarantees a significant reduction in administration processes and a streamlined communication. The implementation of service outsourcing processes has a direct impact at reduction of the workload of client HR department."
395,How do you ensure that you attract the right candidates for our business?,"Our Recruitment Consultants are specialised for different types of industries and profiles and they know the market in their field. More than that, we have always at least a meeting/call with the client to calibrate the profile we are looking for, based on the Job Description received from our client. We know Candidate market as well as demographic figures. Direct search is also an important step to ensure that we find the right candidates."
396,"How do you would minimize the risks within temping around sickness, termination, attrition and performance?","Gi Group minimizes risk by firstly ensuring a thorough recruitment, selection and induction process.  Through this workers understand the expectations of them, not just the tasks they will undertake, but their personal conduct.  With regards to sickness levels, Gi Group investigates the reasons for sickness through back to work interviews.  Should issues arise the team will act upon the results and make recommendations for change.  This could be to any part of the process from recruitment to the way the workers clock in and out for their assignment.  Any performance issues are handled by Gi Group, working in consultation with the hiring manager.  An action plan for improvement will be put into place with timescales for review. Should the worker fail to improve to the standard required then they will be replaced with another worker."
397,Do you have documented issue resolution and communication procedures?,"Gi Group are proud that client satisfaction with our service is consistently high.  Gi Group’s clients and agency workers are well supported throughout their engagement with us. Daily communication with both our agency workers and client hiring managers maximises our ability to manage and monitor operational and temporary worker performance and enables us to identify and correct any inadequacies in supply at a very early stage. Our recruitment processes and procedures are designed to identify candidates most closely aligned to our clients organisational and operational requirements, culture and values, further reducing the risk of assigning disengaged and under-committed candidates.  In the event that any performance issues arise with either an element of our delivery function or one of our temporary workers, we would request that the relevant Gi Group Account Manager be contacted immediately.  The Gi Group escalation route would typically follow the structure below. Issues can be raised in person, by telephone or by email. Dedicated Account Consultant: Should a contract or temporary worker performance issue arise, the first point of contact for complaints escalation would be a relevant Account Consultant. Where possible our Account Consultant will attempt to immediately resolve your complaint. Should an immediate resolution not be possible, our Account Consultant will escalate the complaint to our allocated Account Manager. Regional Account Manager: Our Regional Account Manager will work with you to identify key issues and where relevant action an immediate performance improvement review. Should resolution still not be reached the complaint would then escalate to an Operations Manager. Operations Manager: At the point of issue escalation reaching an Operations Manager, our Executive Governance function will be enacted and representatives from the most senior levels of our organisation will work with you to ensure resolution is reached."
398,What is from your company's perspective the issues/trends affecting the temporary labour industry during covid and briefly describe you company's response?,"The labour market is currently effected by the Covid-19 pandemic. This has had a real impact on temporary recruitment and agencies have had to adapt to accommodate this situation.  At Gi Group we have risk assessments within each office with PPE for personnel.  Recruitment processes have been adapted to offer remote recruitment, minimizing face to face contact.  We continue to work with our clients to understand the needs of their business and the health and safety of the workers.  We are keeping all of our clients up to date with any changes as we receive advice from the local government."
399,With what planning system do you operate and is the opportunity there fort he customer to make use of that system (in the future)?,"Planning system We work with our own planning system, integrated in the cloud solution of Mysolution, which forms the heart of our digital front, mid and back office. This is the best HR software on the market for HR service providers. The team leaders in production also get their own login to the planning system, to make real-time adjustments and always see what is happening in the planning (see the answers to questions 12 and 22 for more information about the planning system. ). Clock system  We also propose the clock system to implement Nedap's PEP Flex. Flex workers clock in and out with their  personal PEP card at a PEP Reader.  PEP registers the clocked hours of the flex workers. The hours are approved by those responsible and then go to the salary package in Mysolution and Gi Group that can process the hours for invoicing.  The PEP system also keeps track of the contract hours and leave balances. This is always clear to those involved.  Clocking in on the PEP Readers can be done upon arrival, but can also be done by cost plate, line or activity, for example. The readers are equipped with a battery and make contact with one PEP gateway that collects all information and sends it to the PEP software. The collection and forwarding is done via the GPRS network by means of a SIM card that is built into the gateway. This will give you a wealth of information about how much and how long work has been carried out to cost center / activity level.  In addition, the manager has the option to view all hours worked in the current and previous weeks of the employee. The hours and entitlements accrued are also transparent. Both the accrued hours / rights and hours worked and allowances are transparent to the employee. It is possible for the manager to make a total overview of the hours worked and to export this. PEP Flex is already linked to Mysolution, so that we can digitally enter the hours via an interface. This reduces the error margins and we can see in real time who is clocked in, which makes attendance checks a lot easier. Running reports is also easy.  The costs for the implementation and use of PEP Flex are already included in our pricing."
400,Could you describe in a short process flow what your process of planning and pool management will look like in the context of Client 's desired planning methodology described in the introduction (planning for availability and competences across departments and teams)?,"The success factors for making and executing the planning and pool management are always communication and the planning tool, both towards each other, and towards the internal organization and flex workers. Because we still have insufficient knowledge of the planning processes at Client  at this stage, other than what is described in the RFP documentation, it is difficult to create a process flow. We have therefore based the process flow below on the basis of our knowledge and experiences with similar production customers.  1. 1 week before planning, a proposal planning is made by Gi Group based on the forecast from Client ; 2. When the proposal schedule is ready, it is available to the team leaders within 48 hours. The team leaders have access via their own login to our planning system to make real-time adjustments; 3. The team leaders have access 5 days before the planning starts. 2 days before the planning starts, they must have entered the changes (think of dividing services, competencies and positions according to their own wishes) 4. We send out planning 2 days in advance for two weeks later; 5. The team leaders can always monitor in real-time what is happening in the planning, so when we make a proposal for a change, the team leaders are also watching. We all see one schedule; 6. We distinguish two phases in our planning system, namely proposal planning and actual planning; 7. After changes, we consult with the team leaders and these changes can be refuted within 24 hours. In short, we always keep in touch with the team leaders; 8. Per department, we schedule a short operational meeting with the team leaders once a week to discuss the changes; 9. The flex workers receive an email or text message with the services (in coordination with Client ); 10. Pool management is organized on the basis of functions and availability; 11. Planning is organized on the basis of departments, teams, positions and competences.  The Mysolution planning tool takes into account the applicable collective labor agreement, the Working Hours Act and other laws and regulations. Within the frameworks set by Client , employees have the option of self-rostering via PC, tablet and smartphone, with the 24/7 app, in the event of ad hoc changes. If something changes in one timetable, the other timetables will automatically adjust accordingly. Gi Group advises Client  on planning and pool management on matters such as:  • Where are the bottlenecks? • Where and when is cross training / education necessary? • When should recruitment start in order to anticipate peaks in time? • How can we improve forecasting together? (based on history) • What is the optimal pile composition and size? • Which mix of target groups works best per profile and / or department?"
401,"Client  has a flat hiring pattern with peaks during Easter, Christmas and during the holiday period. How can you guarantee that as many of the same, well-worked-in forces are used again?","The basics of qualitative pool management is good and frequent communication with the candidates in the pool. The communication is a mix of personal contact through channels, such as; telephone, email, WhatsApp, SMS and social media and automated messages via SalesForce Pardot, our marketing automation tool, which is fully integrated into our HR software Mysolution. If you give enough attention to the candidates in the pool, the pool will remain more filled and up to date. Both the Central Recruitment Team and the Onsite Consultants have a role in pool management. Below we describe three solutions to bind well-developed forces so that they can be used again at a later stage. Shield model  By using a shell model, in which we apply 4 layers in the pool, we can better categorize and retain flex workers. Not everyone wants to work as many hours a week as possible. a. Permanent employees of Client ; b. (Almost) full-time flex workers; create volume in the workforce; also by not always deploying everyone full-time, so that a surplus in the pool becomes available. This keeps the quality and stability high; c. Part-time flex workers; for peaks in the week and weekends. d. Holiday forces / peak forces; flex workers only used to absorb peak times and holidays. In addition to students, you can also think of part-time parents or state pensioners.  Reservation of over hours  What we also use for our customers is to encourage the flex workers in layer D to work overtime, so that after the peak, we pay these hours in phases in order to keep this group of flex workers longer with Client . Pool sharing A third solution is the use of pool sharing, whereby the flex workers are also deployed at other Gi Group customers. For flex workers living independently in the Netherlands, we combine working at Client  with work within a maximum travel time of 45 minutes, but for migrant workers, for whom we also provide housing, transport, insurance, etc., this is possible with our customers throughout the Netherlands. . If we also deploy labor migrants at Client , Gi Group can have the machine instructions translated into English, so that we can also deploy English-speaking flex workers during peak times."
402,Could you descripe you recruitment and sourcing strategy?,"Our sourcing strategy is based on a smart mix of channels & tools for reaching out to relevant active and inactive candidates on the market. The aim is to reach out, select and keep the best candidates available in the area of the Client. Gi Group has a Central Recruitment Team (CRT). This is a centralized and specialized recruitment team based in our HQ in Amsterdam. Thanks to the CRT, we are able to scale up and down very quickly for our customers, because we can schedule recruiters in a timeframe of 3 hours for our customers in The Netherlands. The CRT is responsible for recruitment, pre-selection, reference checks, talent poolmanagement and the arrangement of face-to-face conversations for our On-Site tea,. The CRT makes use of the latest IT applications and, in addition to the traditional telephone line, also makes extensive use of WhatsApp (messages / video), text message, Facebook and FaceTime."
403,What is your team structure and could you give a brief desription of each teammember?,"Solution Manager Involvement starts in the RFP phase, when designing the solution and will work closely with the implementation manager and On-Site team during start-up phase. Will be involved during the contract when we face changes and growth. Implementation Manager Will have a leading role, during implementation phase, working closely with the Solution Manager. Knows the processes, systems and Dutch legislation by head. Works within strict and uniform processes, that have been fine-tuned to operational excellence, by the high number of implementation done over the years. Account Director Oversees the partnership from a tactical and strategical perspective. Is a member of the Dutch board, so has very short lines within the organization. Is present at quarterly and yearly evaluations. Operations Manager Is managing the On-Site team and partially the centralized divisions. The Operations Manager will be present at the quarterly and yearly reviews, to review and improve the partnership between Gi Group and Client. The Operations Manager also acts as level 2 escalation point. Central Recruitment Team This team support the On-Site team with recruitment activities, like; job posting, recruitment marketing campaigns, sourcing, screening, selecting, reference checks and planning of the final interviews with the On-Site Manager. The team also takes care of the Client talent pools. Central Admin Team This team supports the On-Site team regarding back-office, like; salary payment, hour processing, sickness & leave management, etc. and is also the 1st line of contact for temps regarding administrative questions. Central Planning Team This team support the On-site team with the planning, pool management and the replacement of no shows. For our cross-border temps, they also take care of the planning of housing and transport. Finance Team I responsible for the invoicing process, debt management and controlling activities for Client. On-Site Team The On-Site team; On-Site Manager (1 FTE), Shift Supervisors (3 FTE) and On-Site Support (1 FTE)  are covering all the tasks as described by Client in the document “NL_Onsite_Management”. The team as a whole, will also cover the 24/7 reachability demand that comes with the 5-shift rotation model, that will be applicable in The Netherlands. If the volume of Client exceeds 50 FTE, we can consider an extra On-Site Manager, but in our service model, where the On-Site team is supported by centralized departments, we often can reach 75 FTE with 1 On-Site Manager."
404,Is Gi Group capable of verifying the identity and certification of the temporary worker?,Gi Group checks the identity and certification of all her temporary workers As a member of the ABU we are obliged to strictly follow all the rules and regulations which the Dutch Government requires. Twice a year we are audited and thorouhgly checked if we meet up on all the legal demands. For this Gi Group developed a proces regarding the verification of all kinds of documents. Therefor our files and data are always correct and up-to-date.

407,"Could you indicate the measurements included in your offer to ensure compliance with local legislation, ability to support company compliance in terms of policies/procedures/guidelines?","All employees of Gi Group are experts in their workfield due to extensive training, schooling and experience. Most of the consultants and administration employees have their SEU certificate (which covers all temp and overall labor legislation), and are keeping up with the changes in legislation. Our Country Manager is part of the ABU committee, which is the confederation for temp agencies in The Netherlands. Gi Group is a member of the ABU and Vereninging Detacheren NL.  Gi Group is also being advised by consultancy partner Mazars and legal partner Advocaten van Nu. Besides, we have an attorney who is specialized in temp labor. Gi Group is audited on a regular base to check if we still meet the local legislation."
408,What policies and proceedures does your organisation have in place to ensure complaince with all relevant legislation?\r\n\r\nPlease list each relevant legislation and how your organisation ensures compliance.,"Gi Group has a dedicated Compliance Team committed to enhancing our compliance provisions and best practice processes in line with employment law changes and industry best practice. The team provides ongoing compliance training to our staff covering key areas such as GDPR, AWR, Diversity and Inclusion and Modern Slavery to ensure adherence to both internal process and legislative requirements.

Our software system My Solution will immediate be updated with the latest legislation and we will inform all our personnel by training on new the legislation."
409,Can you describe your organisation in The Netherlands?,"Gi Group Netherlands has a nationwide coverage. Regarding temporary labor we mainly focus on corporate companies in Logistics, Production and Customer Care. Through our label Move Up we also are able to provide EU flexworkers. We are part of a worldwide HR service provider which in The Netherlands also supports with her labels Grafton (Recruitment agency) and Fashion & Luxury. We are present at more than 30 locations and our headoffice is located in Amsterdam, just as our branch office. Wij zijn aanwezig op ruim 30 locaties in heel Nederland. Ons hoofdkantoor is gevestigd in Amsterdam, net als onze branch."
410,"What is your mission statement, vision and what are your core values?","Our core values (since 1998) reflect the evolution we have gone through in the last 22 years and they determine the future direction of Gi Group.  Care: with utmost care we do what we have to so we create value for people and customers and support them with simple and efficient solutions for complex problems. Passion: we are passionate about our work and everyone of us is dedicated to meet the needs, ambitions and targets of colleagues, candidates and customers.

Verantwoordelijkheid: We respecteren mensenrechten en diversiteit; we ondersteunen alle wetgeving die meer bescherming biedt aan werknemers en een actieve rol speelt bij het wegnemen van corruptie en elke vorm van misbruik of illegaal gedrag."
411,Can you describe your culture?,"Our organization and the people who work for us are extremely versatile. We can adapt quickly and easily when changes occur. An example is our response to the outbreak of the pandemic, in which we switched quickly and immediately adjusted our processes. We have also responded proactively to the introduction of the new legislation “Balanced Labor Market Act” by aligning our processes, legal structure and contract forms with this. In addition to the short lines within the organization, everyone in the company is accessible, colleagues are always open to feedback and they are available to help each other. Mutually we bring out the best in people through internal training, by constantly motivating each other, by a critical attitude towards each other and towards ourselves and by applying self-reflection. Everyone is given the space to take their own responsibility, instead of constantly checking whether someone is on the right track. Another important aspect of our corporate culture is that we offer growth opportunities to our employees. We like to give our employees the space to continue to develop themselves at a professional level and stimulate people to climb up within the company or to broaden within a field. Our employees are constantly looking for areas for improvement and for smarter ways to optimize our services. We also find it important that everyone is aware of everything that is happening within the company and that everyone is treated equally, regardless of position or role. In addition, between work there is always room for socializing and for conversations about topics outside of work, which creates a strong team and interpersonal relationships."
412,How can you support the client regarding Employer Branding?,"Our marketing specialists and our on-site team are happy to think along with Clientabout employer branding. Nowadays, whether or not an employer branding strategy makes the difference in a tight labor market. Together with Clientwe make a SWOT analysis, in which the key points regarding why candidates want to work at Clientare incorporated. To be able to use objective data as a source, we work together with the Intelligence Group and Jobdigger and we use LinkedIn Insights. We compare this SWOT analysis with a (local) competition analysis, after which we determine together which of the strengths we use in labor market communication, such as recruiting and SEO proof vacancy texts with an attractive layout, but also custom advertisements that we use via online and offline channels. In order to arrive at the most effective mix of channels, we do AB tests where we try multiple channels and variations of advertisements so that we can measure what gives the best results. We always keep costs vs. the expected result in sharp focus. Because we can analyze all data in Mysolution, our HR software, in combination with the functionality of Saleforce Einstein (BI tools with AI functionality), we can use handy dashboards to see which campaigns are most successful. In addition, it is important to understand the candidates, so that together we can make Clientmore interesting for them. Part of understanding the candidate is understanding where their interests lie. In addition, it is essential to look at where this specific group of candidates can be found, so on which platform and via which channel. With this information, suitable vacancies can be written on the right platforms. Another option that Gi Group wants to roll out at Clientin the future is making videos about the flex workers who will start working at Client e-Commerce. This gives an idea of ??what a working day at Clientlooks like. Interviews can also be held with flex workers in which they can tell about their work experience and perception."
413,How does Gi Group organises housing in case of EU flexworkers?,"Every EU flex worker is maximally facilitated by us in his or her requirements to be able to work in the Netherlands and to be successful in the daily work at the customer. Our support of the people is focused on 5 things from which the customer reaps the benefits. Gi Group works together with permanent partners who provide us with quality accommodation. All locations of our partners are registered in the SNF location register. Gi Group sets high standards for the quality of the accommodation, location-bound facilities, the geographical location in relation to social facilities and the integration possibilities."
414,Where is the accommodation for the EU Flexworkers located?,"Our residential locations are centrally located and the regular facilities are within walking distance. We have opted for EU flex workers to be allowed to use the vehicles to go to the supermarket.  Because the location is central to the city center or the center, there is a greater chance of social integration. We encourage this at all times and our Caretakers support our flex workers in registering at the gym or going out with people to familiarize them with the neighborhood. A BRP registration is absolutely recommended and we guide our employees in this."
415,Is Gi Group cerfified in regard of housing?,"Gi Group is SNF certified and the last audit dates from April 8, 2021. We use the hiring register for this. All residential locations independently carry the SNF quality mark and are registered in the location register of the Stichting Normering Flexwonen."
416,What kind of standards does Gi Group have regarding the occupation of rooms for EU flexworkers?,"Our starting point is that everyone has a single room, but here we are strongly dependent on the supply from the market. The long-stay homes at the location indicated above all offer single rooms, the cluster locations offer double rooms."
417,Is it possible for a EU flexworker to arrange private housing?,"If an EU flex worker does not wish to use our housing offer, this is a free choice. If a flex worker deems it desirable to be supported in the search for a private stay, we will assess the feasibility of this per situation. If the situation permits, we will always guide the flex worker in this"
418,How does Gi Group organise transportation for the flexworkers?,"Regarding mobility for our people, we work together with a number of partners who provide us with the means of transport that are no older than 3 months and meet all set safety standards. For large volumes (> 150) we opt for a mix of mobility. We opt for a mix of fixed deployment supplemented with a shuttle service that provides flexibility. We notice that a large number of cross-border employees do not have a valid European driving license. This makes it difficult to have a backup driver on every vehicle. We determine which vehicles to use on the basis of the candidates accepted. The choice for fixed bet is: • Bicycle • Car (4 persons per vehicle) • Bus (9 persons per vehicle)  For the flexibility and in case of short absence of both drivers on, for example, 1 car, employees can use the shuttle service that operates between the work location and the residential location. A bicycle is only offered if the home-work distance is no more than 5 kilometers one way. If someone wants to use his / her own transport, this is a free choice."
419,How are EU flexworkers attended during their stay?,"The guidance of migrant workers at residential locations is provided by the landlord in collaboration with Gi Group. All supervisors are pre-selected, hired and trained by the landlord. The employees are selected, hired and trained as supervisors.  Arrival Upon arrival at the location, residents are digitally registered at house and / or room level. Personal data is registered and a photo is taken and then the resident signs for approval. Upon signing, the house key is handed over and the rules and regulations are explained. After that, a confirmation will be sent to the resident by e-mail. Monitoring and registration Together with the landlord, we record everything in the housing portal, so that we can register, trace and take action. The items below are re-registered. • Occupancy changes • Damages • Complaints • Warnings and / or misconduct   Every official warning issued by the supervisor at the location is registered in the portal, after which the resident automatically receives an email with the warning. Thanks to the integration with our own system, the registration is also recorded directly at a personal level. We say goodbye to the employee at three official warnings. If deportation follows, the employee will receive an e-mail and letter with the urgent request to leave the house within an agreed period of a maximum of 5 days. Policy and control At all locations, the policy of the landlord of the accommodations is followed and possibly supplemented by Gi Group. The residents are informed both orally and in writing in advance. Supervisors and our Caretakers do a weekly inspection round of the accommodations. Three aspects are assessed: order, hygiene and cleanliness. They keep track of this through issue management. All results are available in the portal and easy to check. All locations are manned 24/7 by at least 1 supervisor and 1 Caretaker. In case of escalation, security is always on standby.    Zero Tolerance All locations have a Zero Tolerance policy regarding possession and / or use of drugs, public intoxication, violence, excessively aggressive behavior and sexual harassment. No written warnings will be issued for this, but deportation will immediately proceed."
420,What KPI's do you track and report?,"We report in the format of a PowerPoint presentation with per KPI: 1. Result KPI 2. Reason KPI 3. Improvement action  A monthly and quarterly structural meeting (evaluation meetings) are the basis for the service continuity as well as a continuous improvement of our services. During this meeting, the results of the SLA’s and KPI’s are discussed."
421,What is the guarantee period regarding permanent placement?,"If the cooperation between client and candidate is terminated during the first month, you will receive a credit note. The following percentage will be returned in the aforementioned weeks after the start date of the candidate: Week 1 t/m 3:                   75% Week 4 en 5:                     50% Week 6 en 7:                     40% Week 8 en 9:                     30% Week 10 t/m 13:              20%"
422,Which certifications does Gi Group have and with what sector organizations are you affiliated?,"Gi Group has a number of important certificates. Gi Group S.p.A is a corporate member of the World Employment Confederation, the leading staffing union worldwide, see http://www.wecglobal.org. The World Employment Confederation, active in 50 countries, is the voice of the labor market sector on a global level and represents 7 of the largest international organizations active in the delivery of labor market solutions; including Gi Group. Gi Group Temp B.V is a member of ABU (Algemene Bond Uitzendondernemen). The ABU organization helps employment agencies to add value to society. ABU membership is a hallmark for quality and good employment practices. The establishment of the Association of Detachers Netherlands (VvDN) has been a fact since the beginning of 2019. That same year, Grafton (Gi Group Perm B.V.) joined the organization. Members of the association are organizations or independent labels that consider secondment as their core activity and are active in the Netherlands. The SNA quality mark is the quality mark for the temporary employment sector and work contractors and has been developed to limit the risks of hirers of labor and clients of work. Secondment workers and payroll companies also fall under the scope of the quality mark because they also make work available. https://www.normeringarbeid.nl/ Stichting Normering Flexwonen manages the registers of companies that meet the standard for housing for labor migrants and maintains these standards. Organizations that offer housing for labor migrants can obtain a certificate from the Stichting Normering Flexwonen. To do this, they must meet the standard for housing for labor migrants. https://www.normeringflexwonen.nl/ The PayOK Foundation aims to test companies within the chain for compliance with the Wet Aanpak Schijnconstructies (WAS). Because the (main) client is responsible for the remuneration in the entire chain, the assessment by PayOK provides a good insight into the risks that the (main) client runs. By requiring all companies in the chain to be PayOK certified, the risk of incorrect payment claims in the chain is minimized. https://www.pay-ok.nl/"
423,What services does your organization offer outside of staffing?,"In addition to temporary employment services, whereby in addition to the local recruitment of flex workers (NL-flex), we also have a cross-border organization called Move Up (EU-flex), we offer our customers the following types of services: • Recruitment • Secondment • Detavast (starts as secondment, followed by a takeover) • Assisted Recruitment Services • Payrolling (in accordance with new guidelines “Balanced Labor Market Act) • Freelance mediation • Freelance brokering • HR Consultancy • Assessments • Outsourcing"
424,"Do you offer a KPI portal with dashboards, where management reports and real-time data are displayed?","We believe that we must measure key figures (KPIs) in order to manage our organization and to continue to learn. We do this at Gi Group, but also specifically for Client. We share the results monthly via an export from our system, dashboards and we discuss during fixed monthly and quarterly meetings.  We have all our applications on one platform, namely Mysolution. All data is made accessible in the Salesforce environment, where we use Salesforce Einstein as a data warehouse with Artificial Intelligence functionality. Because we ourselves have the knowledge and expertise to ""build"" on this platform, we can unlock (almost) all the desired real-time data for our customers in simple and clear dashboards.  In the field of management reports, our customers can see, for example, the hours worked per person per week, average hourly wages, average hourly rate, hour type per Plant or department, but also complex KPI reports, such as; degree of fulfillment, turnover, illness, length of stay and the like. In the area of planning (if Gi Group does this for you) you can see who is scheduled when and to what extent the planning is balanced.  We have also integrated the applications of Intelligence Group and Jobdigger on this platform. This provides us with a target group dashboard, where we can find all data from various sources and provide us with supply analysis, labor market analysis and target group analysis at a very detailed level. We can even see benefits from Client 's competitors in the same region, looking for the same profiles, as well as push and pull factors associated with these profiles. The possibilities are endless. With these BI tools we can quickly see changes in the labor market, competition and economic changes."
425,"Can you provide cross-border workers as temps? If so, can you indicate which nationalities you can supply?","Yes, Gi Group supplies both target groups, both separately and in the mix. Since Gi Group is active in 58 countries, we can supply almost any nationality. Nationalities with which we have gained good experience in recent years at production companies in the Food and FMCG are; Latvia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Spain. If a company consciously chooses a policy of diversity and inclusion, we recommend that a dominant nationality does not arise in the workplace and in the flex workforce, as a result of which this has too much impact on the corporate culture and atmosphere. This can be easily achieved through the use of smart pool management and monitoring the mix."
426,"What (extra) added value can your organization offer Client , or what is the distinctive character of your organization?","Our temporary employment agency is fully specialized in (onsite) services to companies in the production, logistics and customer care sectors. For this reason, our unique delivery model is scalable, allowing us to easily ""move"" with the extreme peak requirements known within these sectors. This enables us to manage both the on-site team and our centrally organized teams around activities such as; quickly scaling up recruitment (local and in Europe), planning and administration in capacity, enabling us to deliver large volumes of flex workers and guaranteeing quality. In addition, we offer added value to all parties involved in this chain, because we have housed all our applications and data flows on one digital platform in the user-friendly Salesforce environment, which enables us to offer uniformity, insight and control over all processes related to inflow. throughflow and outflow of flexible hiring, by making this data accessible via handy web portals."
427,After how many hours / hours can employees be taken over directly by (an operating company of) Client ?,"Client  is only entitled to enter into a direct employment relationship with a flex worker who is / was made available if he has worked at least 1.040 regular hours for Gi Group. When Client  enters into a direct employment contract with the flex worker, who works as a labor migrant, Gi Group will immediately stop providing extra services such as accommodation, transport, etc. to the flex worker."
428,What do you do to retain and fascinate employees?,"Labor is human work. By giving flex workers the right attention, staff turnover, absenteeism and No Show are reduced and involvement is increased. By drawing up a retention plan, we ensure that the flex workers have a bond with Client  and Gi Group. Four needs are central to the retention plan; work, pay, attention and development. After the right match, the guidance of the flex workers begins. Gi Group guides the flex workers placed at Client  in a human, yet structured way. The flex workers are guided because: • Gi Group is the official employer and attaches importance to satisfied flex workers; • A satisfied flex worker likes to go to work; • A satisfied flex worker performs excellently; • A satisfied flex worker is not very absent and stays longer at Client .  Work-oriented guidance for Client  • Thanks to our many years of experience, we know exactly what the flexworker expects from us as an employer. Based on this knowledge, a coaching process has been developed in which the flex worker is central. 1. Guidance during the induction process by the Consultant. 2. Contact moment at the end of the first working day and working week by the Consultant. 3. Check for need / motivation for training by the Consultant. 4. Monitoring progress during a training by Consultant. 5. Contact moment at the end of the trial period by the Consultant with the manager of Client . 6. End of the first month of probationary interview by Consultant. 7. Structured evaluation moments (every quarter) by the Consultant. 8. Compliance with Client  assessment system by Consultant. 9. Christmas gift and birthday card by the Consultant. 10. Employee satisfaction survey by the Consultant.  Exit call • If a flex worker or Gi Group decides to stop working, an exit interview will always take place. The results of an exit interview will be discussed with the relevant manager and included in the quarterly evaluation. Striking matters will also be directly fed back to HR. If a decision is taken by Client  that the flex worker must stop his activities, a reason will be given to Gi Group from Client ."
429,How does your company ensure that customer service candidates is right for Client  and Client  is right for the candidate?,"Our recruiters search for hard criteria to make a long list of suitable candidates. These candidates are approached by telephone or by video calling. Then it is assessed whether they meet the required competencies and soft skills. If that is correct, at least one reference will be checked. Once this step has been completed, the candidate will be interviewed by the onsite consultant who will give a final assessment. The onsite consultant knows the requested profiles well, as well as the corporate culture and atmosphere in the department, so that the candidate is also matched accordingly.  In addition to our structured processes, we take a language test and calculation test for every possible candidate for CCC, combined with asking a number of open questions related to Client 's matching requirements."
430,What kind of tests and assessment do you apply during selection of white collar temps?,"We have a language test and calculation test that we now use for other contact center customers. After awarding, we will tailor these language tests for Client . We will involve you in this during the implementation process. We can of course share the results of the tests with you if this is beneficial during the selection process."
431,What does your hiring process look like?,"Inflow: • Recruitment through online and offline channels • Pre-selection / check strict requirements • Skype / telephone interview recruiter (possibly pre-assessment, language and math test) • Face-to-Face Interview / assessment • Terms of employment interview • Contract / File / Admin • Onboarding • Start Flexkracht • Guidance / retention Flow through: • Accompaniment • Education • Evaluations • Transfer options Outflow: • Exit call • Being able to estimate in advance when someone will leave • Prevention of outflow"
432,"How will you check the candidate's VOG, immigration status, medical examination etc.?","After application, the original VOG must be submitted within four weeks. During the intake on site, the Onsite Consultant checks the identification of the potential employee for authenticity and validity by means of at least two security features, namely, the tangible relief and the water shadow mark. If it concerns a residence permit, the potential employee must show the official letter with the BSN number or a health insurance card. If a work permit is required, the potential employee must also show this. This is checked for authenticity by the Consultant. Medical examinations are checked in consultation with the Client within the restrictions of the Dutch law for the relevant points for the Client."
433,What does your process of evaluation of the candidates look like?,"Interim assessment is always in consultation with the customer, as an assessment system has often already been set up. Gi Group's standard procedure is as follows: • Evaluation first day (by telephone by Consultant) • Evaluation first week (by telephone by Consultant) • Evaluation first month (if possible on site by Consultant, if desired with the candidate's manager) • Evaluation after six months (on site by Consultant, preferably together with managerial candidate) • Annual evaluation (on site by Consultant, preferably together with managerial candidate) All assessments and communication are saved in the Gi Group CRM system."
434,"How is your working method regarding absenteeism, registration and guidance and how do you deal with the contracts with the employees in this case?","Absence must be reported by the employee to the administration department. If desired, this will be passed on to Client  if there is no direct possibility. Absenteeism is registered in the CRM as well as in the back office. This will then be passed on to the UWV. Administration maintains contact with the employee during the illness, in case of long-term illness (longer than 5 working days) or frequent sickness reports (2 times within 2 months or more), this is supplemented by the Consultant. Long-term sick worker who cannot return will be transferred to the UWV."
435,How do you attract candidates?,"• Nurturing databases of active and latent seeking candidates and employees for return. • Gi Group can also use references as a recruitment channel. We motivate our candidates with incentives in the form of value coupons during our tell-a-friend referral recruitment actions. • Gi Group can also pay the temps who stay on-board until the end of the peak season a retention fee. • Display advertising. • Banners on websites with specified target group affinity, corresponding with geographical data . • Action-driven landing pages that focus on the traffic and provide application points to the candidates: o First mobile design of these landing pages. o Fast application process & flexible application form."
436,How do you attract and recruit good candidates? What software and data sources do you use?,"In a rapidly changing market, it is necessary to keep renewing and innovating. Smartphones, Big Data, Smart Analytics, Social Media, Communities, Machine Learning and Apps have become part of our lives. For recruitment, Gi Group uses the most innovative online channels, trusted and effective offline channels and other modern tools. We use the Applicant Tracking Software to increase the productivity of our Recruiters, and to manage the entire recruitment funnel and registration process. Nevertheless, we make use of the Intelligence Group software, which enables us to have an insight on the market and a complete analysis of it. Also, Gi Group has a lot of experience in the area the region and knows it by heart. By AB-testing and analyzing all our data, we have developed a strong understanding of which campaigns and recruitment channels are the most successful per target group, geographical area and profile. Our current strategy is that we constantly hunt for the best candidates, instead of a passive approach where you wait for applications on the job advertisements and only use the existing database."
437,Could you give us some examples of offline recruitment channels you use?,"• The back of the bus and/or bus stop posters. • Hand-out leaflets, posters at schools, universities, student hotels and industrial areas. • Advertising in local papers, magazines and local sponsoring, etc."
438,How do you use attificial intelligence (AI) to analyse data and apply machine learning in you recruitment proces?,"We use Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning for the pre-screening of candidates that apply to one of our open vacancies. When a candidate applies to one of our job profiles or registers itself on our website, AI will pre-screen the candidate that results into a ranking. The candidates with the highest ranking appear on top of the dashboard of the recruitment team, so the recruiters can make choices that are based on the work that has already been done by AI. The ranking of the AI is based on the following criteria: • Candidate profile; • Vacancy profile; • Comparison with other candidates in the database; • Account profile. While AI assess and compares all these criteria’s, the outcome is a ranking within a scale. The more candidates go through our system, the smarter the AI gets by machine learning. The advantage for Client is, we increase the quality of our process and candidates on a standardized way, for the entire recruitment team."
439,What is you experience around working with co-vendors?,"Gi Group uses sub suppliers for two specific reasons: • Quality; in cases where a specific question (profile) requires a specialized supplier. • Quantity; When a volume request is so challenging at any given time, it takes multiple suppliers to meet it. Gi Group works with a trusted selection of sub suppliers for both quality and quantity issues."
440,How do you secure that all documents during the onboarding are signed and stored and uniform?,"In our Salesforce driven software, My Solution, we can upload the required documents which need to be signed by every worker. The system blocks if the documents are not signed. We will save the signed documents in our system."
441,How do you specifically plan to build up the flex pool of students and the holiday pool?,"Recruitment This target group of students requires a different approach than we use for regular vacancies. For this target group we make more use of social media channels such as Instagram, Snapchat, Tiktok,etc. Possibilities for offline campaigns (such as at MBO / HBO schools, universities, sports associations or other channels) are also included. From reports displayed by our recruitment software, we can immediately measure and manage the success factors during each campaign.  Keeping contact  Keep in touch with the pool by telephone, WhatsApp, SMS or other popular channels through a fixed schedule. And send automated, but personalized messages at important moments such as birthdays, graduation, new year transition. The aim is to maintain the pool.  Reward system  The options for retaining this target group can also include a reward system that can be saved for something per hour worked. This will certainly ensure maintenance of the pool in the summer period."
442,How has Gi Group taken care of the insurance for her EU flexworkers?,"Every labor migrant receives standard health insurance from us. We arrange this at Holland Zorg. If an employee wishes to opt out of this, this must be indicated to us in writing. Gi Group receives a group discount of 5%, this discount is settled towards the flex workers."
443,Could you describe the recent innovations of Gi Group?,"Our organization is fully specialized in (onsite) services to companies in the production and logistics sector. For that reason, our unique delivery model is scalable, so that we can easily ""move"" with the extreme peak requirements known within these sectors. This enables us to manage both the on-site team and our centrally organized teams around activities such as; quickly scaling up recruitment (local and in Europe), planning and administration in capacity, enabling us to deliver large volumes of flex workers and guaranteeing quality. Across all these processes, we offer added value to all parties involved in this chain, because we have housed all our applications and data flows on one digital platform in the user-friendly Salesforce environment, enabling us to offer uniformity, insight and control over all processes related to inflow, throughflow and outflow of flexible hiring, by making this data accessible via handy web portals. Below is a selection of some innovations that we deploy for our customers on our Mysolution platform."
444,Does Gi Group provide a client portal?,"Gi Group uses Mysolution, the best all-in-one HR solution for agencies available on the Dutch market, where front, mid and back office data is integrated into one system on the Salesforce platform. All our functionalities are integrated in the same environment, so we support a full life cycle of the data and connect all points. Instead of just using the standard Mysolution functionalities, we have added a large number of supporting applications, such as; Salesforce Einstein, OnRecruit, Company.info, Jobdigger, Intelligence Group, Avnio, InGoedeBanen, etc. Another valuable application of Mysolution is that we can build a custom made portal for Client e-Commerce, where we can parts in the Salesforce environment such as a real-time planning overview, management reports, KPI dashboards and job tracking, but also more basic data such as; average hourly rate, average multiplier, the number of hours per type per week per department, etc."
445,You must submit a proposal for a Service Level Agreement and the associated KPIs.,"The Service Level Agreement (SLA) is the most important document between Client and Gi Group and describes the cooperation and agreements between both parties. The purpose of an SLA is to make binding agreements about the quality parameters of the service and about the reports. Performance and services provided are continuously measured with Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) defined in the SLA. We believe that we need to measure key figures (KPIs) to manage our organization and to continue to learn. We do this Gi Group broadly, but also specifically for Client. We share the results monthly via an Excel export from our system and discuss them at regular consultation moments.  Gi Group proposes the following KPIs to Client: • Fulfillment rate (= the number of successful placements vs. number of applications) - 99% on forecast - 95% other • Complaints (= the number of complaints on an annual basis) - • No shows (= the number of candidates who do not show up, with the exception of timely replacement) - • Invoice accuracy = the number of incorrect invoices / by the total number of invoices. - 99.5%  We are happy to determine a definitive set of fixed KPIs together with Client."
446,What advise can you give the Client around planning?,Gi Group advises Client on planning on matters such as: • Where are the bottlenecks? • Where and when is cross training / education necessary? • When should recruitments be set up to anticipate peak periods in time? • How can we improve forecasting together? (based on historical data) • What pool size is needed per target group? • What is the optimal pool composition?
447,What software does your company use to keep track of your customers data and reporting?,"Gi Group Netherlands Use My Solution in Sales Force. In this program it is possible to make a portal per customer with custom made reports which show live/actual data. For instance we can show you the average hourly rate, the average multiplier, the amount of hours per week per department. But we can also create a dashboard for specific KPI's at the Client."
448,"Could you work out a concise action plan for the implementation period, including a migration plan?","1. A planning including a well-developed communication and migration plan, including concrete detailed steps, milestones and a critical path, in which it is clear that the (activities for the) implementation will be ready within 8 weeks. 2. The composition of a dedicated project team, including one central contact person; 3. A description of the manner of aftercare after the implementation phase; 4. A description of what is expected of the customer during this period.  In our opinion, a successful implementation / migration consists of 5 elements: 1. A qualitative implementation team, composed of experienced professionals (at all levels), who have already completed many migrations; 2. A migration team that is already involved during the RFP phase, so understands Client 's expectations, wishes and requirements; 3. Freeing up extra resources during the implementation / migration, so that we always have enough people to complete this process on time and properly; 4. Thorough preparation, planning, control and implementation; 5. ""Cooperate"" in advance as a flex worker in the departments, so that the onsite teams understand the operational activities and requirements at Client  well.In our opinion, a successful implementation / migration consists of 5 elements: What we expect from Client  is: - Good communication - Support and involvement on all levels - Insight in stakeholders ? 1. Care after the implementation face Even after the implementation phase, we will be more than usual on-site on location at fixed times, so that the flex workers can contact us with all their questions and we will handle this for Client . Personal contact is the key here. During the first few weeks, we regularly check per person whether everything is going well with the salary and whether everything is clear regarding the candidate portal and candidate file. We also put the implementation and migration, the first two months, on the agenda of the regular consultation moments with Client . In addition, flex workers can always call our CPA department, which is specially designed to answer first-line questions from flex workers. The back-office specialists know the ins and outs with regard to remuneration, legislation and regulations and the application of the hirer's remuneration at Client , so quickly remove any ambiguity. 2. Customer expectations during implementation and migration The starting point is that we unburden Client  during the implementation and migration as much as possible and that everything runs smoothly. Client  must be able to remain fully focused on the core activity, namely production and for the flex workers, only the logo above the salary slip must change and the rest remain the same and familiar. The expectations in the form of actions can be found in the schedule under point 1. Gi Group also provides Client  with a complete package, including all documentation for the releasing party, information sheets, FAQ, presentations for the kick-off meetings and information sessions with flex workers, but also action and decision lists, etc. are ready to use. Thanks to our extensive experience with implementations and migrations of groups of tens to hundreds of flex workers, this is in good hands with Gi Group. That's a promise."
449,We would like to receive a proposal for an SLA for Client . Be specific and concise!,"The master vendor role that Gi Group takes up is central to the service. In addition to a total delivery responsibility, Gi Group can also be held accountable for the quality and performance of the delivered goods. The agreements made in the contract and the Service Level Agreement therefore relate to all flex workers supplied to Client  via Gi Group. How the collaboration between Gi Group and other agencies is organized is a responsibility of Gi Group (the master vendor) and will therefore not form part of this contract. The points listed below are a summary of the agreements between Gi Group and Client  in the field of service provision. The aim of this SLA is to make binding agreements about the quality parameters of the service provision and about the reporting that should lead to an improvement in the quality of the service. The KPIs have been added to indicate the importance of a number of specific points within the whole of Gi Group's services.  • Management information Management information will be provided by Gi Group every 4 weeks at various levels. This information will be discussed during the 4-weekly and quarterly evaluation moments as included in the communication matrix.  • Quality Evaluations are regularly carried out in accordance with the schedule to keep the quality (performance, reliability, competences) of the flex workers as high as possible and to continuously monitor and improve them. On average, the outcome of all evaluations must be at least “satisfactory” overall.  • Phase management Gi Group identifies the phase in which the flex worker is. This signaling is discussed once every 4 weeks in the operational consultation.  • Accessibility Gi Group We work with our Flexpool Coordinators in shifted shifts between 06:00 and 22:00 hours 7/7 and offer 1st line self-support as an IT solution between 22:00 and 06:00. The self-support functionality, fulfills the replacement demand, by automatically sending a message to the reserve pool of candidates, allowing the available flex workers to schedule themselves to fill the shift. Thanks to this automated smart tooling, any other candidates who have also responded will be unsubscribed and the shift will be confirmed to the flex worker who has acted the fastest. The remuneration system rewards the most flexible flex workers. A lot is possible in the field of remuneration, but we are happy to coordinate this personally with Client . During the week, our Onsite Consultants normally work within office hours, so from 08:30 - 17:00, but if the client's duty roster makes it smarter to start the day structurally earlier, for example, we sometimes opt for shifted shifts. Outside the weekday working hours of the on-site operation, other solutions can also be devised to meet the replacement demand. An example of an alternative solution is: Daily up-to-date reserve pool in Mysolution with substitute workers, which is managed by a senior flex worker or a Client  team leader, who approaches the candidates by telephone. An advantage of this can be the personal contact and that you approach specific candidates first.  • Information material Gi Group will use or compile information material that is made available to flex workers who are placed at Client . Keeping this information material up-to-date lies with Client . Gi Group will always provide the latest version to the flex workers.  • Safety Gi Group will ensure that all flex workers are informed about and sign a statement that they are aware of the applicable health and safety rules within Client . Gi Group must also ensure a 100% comprehensive check on subjects such as work or residence permits (in the case of non-Dutch flex workers). Gi Group will ensure that all flex workers have the correct safety shoes (S3 = standard and is reimbursed by Gi Group). Other personal protective measures and clothing for flex workers will be purchased by Client ."
450,Which standard do you think you will set for the first 4 KPI's?,"Part of the management information is a set of fixed KPIs containing at least the following KPIs: • Services requested and provided (Delivery percentage, gross and net> 4 hours before start): 97% • (unwanted) turnover rate: 3% • Provision for ad-hoc questions (services requested on a daily basis • KPIs on correct time processing and invoicing: 99% accuracy (if hours are delivered digitized) • Development of the average hourly rate: In view of the increasing reduction in youth wages, we expect to achieve little savings with the target group of young people. We can, however, actively deploy the use of holiday workers and those entitled to AOW, for which a more competitive cost price applies.  • Other possible KPI’s: Sickness:  We share our KPIs through a report that we can generate at any time from Mysolution our HR software with real-time information, available in handy dashboards. These reports are shared with Client  on a monthly basis before the start of operational meetings. We calculate all KPIs on the average of a period of one year."
451,"Regarding permanent placement, which elements are covered in the fixed fee?","The fixed fee in case of a permanent placement includes holiday allowance and other emoluments, such as profit share settlement, tantième and a 13th month. We always calculate the fee over a full-time salary, even if the actual job has part-time hours."
452,What is the distance from your nearest office to our plant/location?,"At this time Gi Group Netherlands has more than 30 (onsite) locations throughout the country and we are continuously groing. Our headoffice is located in Amsterdam in the same building together with our first branch office. We can say we are practically always in close range to our client's location. Thanks to our fully equiped onsite model we can open up a location anywhere in the Netherlands from a volume of 1.000 hours per week, also in very remote locations (we can provide references)."
453,Does Gi Group offer free lance services?,Gi Group is experienced in working with freelancers. Calculation is based on the hourly rate of the freelancer. We apply a standard mark-up of 20% margin on top of the hourly rate of the freelancer.
454,How does Gi Group apply secondment contract forms?,"We apply a secondment rate equal to the gross salary including bonuses and special emoluments multiplied with a factor of 2.4. The minimum duration of a secondment contract is 6 months, based on a full-time employment. We always work with back-to-back contracts."
455,"What possibilities does your organization have, and advise, regarding the training and examination of the candidates, specifically for production and logistics?","Gi Group will use the entire training budget, which is built up by the wage bill Phase A of the temporary workers at Client , to educate and train the temporary workers employed by Client . We look at the needs of Client  and the individual needs of the temporary workers. This includes, among other things, a forklift or reach truck training, and in consultation with Client  (in connection with the use of the location) a high-rise truck certificate. Language training is also possible. For the White Collar profiles we can offer training through our company TACK / TMI, where training is given in the field of personal development, leadership and changes and innovations. To test; There are a number of requirements that a candidate must meet in order to be eligible for the position in question. The in-house consultant will conduct an interview, on location, with different candidates to find a match for the requested position. For example, if there is a lift, the intermediary will, together with the candidate, like to use a small space at the location where testing can take place.  There will also be a language test if language knowledge is necessary, this test will be taken in writing and orally. In the case of higher (specialist or management positions), a personality test can also be taken at the request of Client . Finally, driving tests for a forklift truck will always be carried out under the supervision of Client ."
456,What is your vision on the cooperation agreement within the bounderies of a maximum 2 suppliers on 100 blue collar temps?,"In the “First Memorandum of Information”, Client  sets the goal of selecting two main suppliers, who use sub-suppliers where necessary (existing parties, if any), in order to be able to comply with a further agreed KPI set. We propose to maintain a 50/50 market share split among the two main providers. In order for this process to run smoothly, uniform agreements must be made with all parties about the services / activities and the performance / KPIs must be monitored via one digital dashboard with real-time data, accessible to both the main supplier, sub-suppliers) as Client  via well-organized web portals. Gi Group has a similar system and if the other main provider does not have this functionality, it can make this service (within the framework of the privacy legislation) available to third parties, under further agreed conditions.  We recommend that you place the small Plants with one main supplier, cluster them where possible, and distribute the large Plants evenly. This creates intensive cooperation between all parties, whereby we join forces and create a quality advantage for Client . At these large Plants, clear agreements must be made between Client  and the two main suppliers regarding processes, such as; intake, onboarding, planning, on-site staffing, off-boarding, accessibility, systems, consultation structure, etc., whereby a pleasant cooperation and optimal service towards Client  are central. For the large Plants, we recommend using the same market share distribution for the following services: 1. Unfulfilled services; 2. Ad hoc services; 3. Replacement services for unwanted outflows. In concrete terms, this means that we rotate between the two main providers, with regard to the interpretation of a service that has become open as described in variants 1 to 3, regardless of which main provider this service originates from, whereby the main providers are forced in an organic way to ensure let in, retain and deliver sufficient quantity based on the request. We can also facilitate the planning, distribution and tracking of the open services, from our web portals, so that everything is available digitally and in real-time for all involved."
457,How and where do you source the right candidates?,"Our recruiters have the right competences such as; empathy, listening skills and knowledge of the sector. Our recruitment team has all possible tools to reach the right target groups:  • Extensive possibilities on Linkedin: Premium; Continuous posting of ""jobs""; Linkedin Recruiter; • Nationalevacaturebank.nl: CV database search; ‘Topbanen’; many advertisement opportunities;  • Indeed: budgeted advertisements, CV database search;  • Advertisement opportunities on topic related websites;  • Multi-posting on diverse free jobboards;  • UWV: Contacts with national en regional UWV offices;  • Social Media: Instagram and Facebook campagnes.  Accurate and continuous management of your own talent pools in our professional CRM system. The results of searching, hunting and farming through our ""purchasing channels"" are continuously measured, so that we know which ones are successful. This gives us insight into where we should focus more in order to achieve maximum results.   We regularly perform labor market analyzes and benchmarks so that we are always aware of the local and national labor market. In addition, we are constantly informed about new, innovative recruitment methods. We subject recruited candidates to a thorough competence-based interview, after which we request relevant references. We use these tools to create an extensive profile so that we get a true and fair view of the candidate before he or she comes to you for an interview."
458,How does your company manage different pools? (poolmanagement),"In order to make a planning system work, we will create a pool of candidates based on a medium and long term planning. From this pool we can fulfill new services, accommodate outflow and replace No Shows. If flexibility and the associated planning are not properly arranged, there is a risk that flex workers will not be deployed enough hours to meet their minimal financial need. A too high turnover is the result. We can make an important difference by securing his / her minimum income for the flex worker. The way in which Gi Group designs its flex pools takes these needs into account. As a counterpart to the above wish, when all flex workers from the flex pool are deployed almost all available hours, there is no longer any possibility to absorb unexpected peaks. The scalability is then gone. For example, we compensate for this by having part of the pool consist of part-timers who are less income-dependent, such as students, holiday workers, two-income earners, AOW beneficiaries and possibly subsidy candidates, the so-called layer model."
459,What is the training budget of your company?,"For the flexworkers at Client, Gi Group invests a maximum of 1.02% of the gross wages of the flexworkers who work in phase A. Together we would like to see how we can use this training budget in such a way that it offers maximum added value for flex workers and Client, of course this varies per profile. Some examples where the trainings budget is used for: • Forklift / reach truck certificate • Industry certificate Customer Care • Commercial training • HACCP training (food environment) • Language course"
460,"How do you benchmark your employee’s subject matter expertise and knowledge of federal, state, provinces and local laws, rules, regulations applicable to temporary labor services?","All employees of Gi Group are experts in their workfield due to extensive training, schooling and experience. Most of the consultants and administration employees have their SEU certificate (which covers all temp and overall labor legislation), and are keeping up with the changes in legislation. Br. Our Country Manager is part of the ABU comittee, which is the confedaration for temp agencies in The Netherlands. Gi Group is a member of the ABU and Vereninging detacheren NL.  Gi Group is also being advised by consultancy partner Mazars and legal partner Advocaten van Nu. Besides, we have an attorney who is specialized in temp labor."
461,"How do you provide proactive advisory to your clients on any changes to existing regulations and new regulations which could impact the business in acquiring temporary labor such as changes to paid sick time, minimum wage increases, OSHA, COVID-19, etc.","We provide at every operational or strategic evaluation moment with Client  proactive advisory about changing regulations. If the changes require immediate action, we will send an email or otherwise communicate immidiately."
462,"Are there any pending plans for merger, acquisition (staffing suppliers, technology) or business expansion (new branch offices) in the next 12 months?","In 2020, Gi Group Netherlands started a cooperation with MySolution Software and Intelligence Group.  In 2021, Gi Group started the expansion of a branch network to deliver temping services and permanent recruitment for small and medium sized clients. Over the last 22 years, Gi Group Holding International has done over 50 mergers and acquisitions. In The Netherlands, we are also in the exploratory phase for an acquisition."
463,"What program structure(s) do you recommend for Client  to fill both Professional (white-collar) and Frontline (blue-collar) assignments in Europe?  Please provide all the possible structures we are looking for out of the box thinking, creative ways to source quality temporary labor while achieving on-time fill rates.","We can service all program structures, which are; Grafton, Move-Up, SMS and External suppliers. Grafton is our professional brand and expert in the Search & Selection of white-collar profiles. For the blue-collar assignment, we have our services Move-Up and SMS. We deliver blue-collar employees from the local labor market and cross border solutions. Because of the mix between those recruitment possibilities, we will deliver the best possible service. We always work onsite. Where traditional agencies often operate from branches, our Consultants always work from a customer location and hereby partly fill in for Client . They are an extension of Client  and because of the (part-time) On-site presence, they know exactly what is going on in the operation and with our flex workers. We are physically present onsite for more hours than the standard at temporary employment agencies and are convinced that this is the only right way to achieve maximum retention and performance. In our opinion, the onsite model is the only way to properly implement the HR partnership that Client  aspires to have. The close interdependence between the organizations in the deployment of a large group of flex workers based on temporary employment in a so-called triangular employment relationship, combined with the requirements and wishes with regard to service provision from Client , means that regular but efficient communication is the only key to success. The Corona pandemic has taught the world to adapt to more remote communication through channels like; Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Skype for Business, etc. What has also become clear is that personal physical contact on the work floor is indispensable to strengthen a relationship and to find  creative solutions together."
464,Have you managed any of your clients  as the Master Vendor or Managed Service Provider?,"Yes, we have experience in working with a Master Vendor construction, but not as the Master. However, we work for over a year together with Agile1 on the Merck Sharp & Dome account. Gi Group provides the contracts for perm, temp, freelance and payroll for Merck Sharp & Dome account where Agile1 is the neutral MSP. We also work in other multi-vendor structures with other competitors, based on a fixed market share, where we divided the Master Vendor activities among the preferred suppliers, based on the strenght per supplier. Also, for Client  we can adjust our service to get the best working solution. Whether that will be a vendor preferred structure (what we now see as the best solution for The Netherlands) or any other service model."
465,"Indicate the number of years for each service level your company has been providing Temporary Labor Services as an MSP provider, Vendor Neutral,  Vendor Preferred, Master Vendor, others?  Please provide a detailed list of all the clients where you are providing each of the said services?",Simei: we work as vendor preferred for Simei since 2019  MSD: since 2020 we work as vendor preferred for MSD for VMS Agile1 B&S: vendor preferred since 2017
466,"Do you currently manage a VMS technology, if yes which one(s)?  Are any in-house developed or 3rd party software?  Does the VMS technology support multiple languages?","Pixid,  Accelaration VMS Agile 1, Careerix for Koramic2Engage. MySolution Software All programs support multiple languages."
467,Describe the training programs you offer your temporary employees?,"Our goal is to strongly increase the quality of the new temporary worker using a thorough selection process, efficient training and a specific integration. As a standard, we provide basic courses for logistics (safety, HACCP, reach truck driver, forklift driver, warehousing, etc.) and develop user-specific trainings on request.    Gi Group reserves 1,02% for training, schooling and education purposes for the benefit of the temporary workers assigned at the Client. Gi Group can use this for all job applicable trainings. If a temporary worker has taken one course, he or she goes back to zero worked hours in this counting system.  Example of a training plan, we developed for another logistic client: • LOI English for starters / 350 hours • Forklift beginner (2 days) / 600 hours • Forklift advanced (1 day) / 400 hours • Forklift repeat 200 hours • Reach forklift beginner (2 days) / 600 hours • Reach forklift advanced (1 day) / 400 hours • Reach forklift repeat / 200 hours • BHV / 400 hours"
468,Please detail strategy for supplying adapted quality and quantity in highly competitive areas.,"In this scares labour market and competitive economic environment, we will analyse the 'total package' of each job profile with Client. We will compare elements like; salary, recognition, extra allowances, working environment, perspective to enter into a direct employment/contract, company parties, Christmas gifts etc. with the competitors of Client in the area. We also analyse the availability of target groups in the area like; fulltime workers, part-time workers, students, house mothers/fathers, above pension age workers etc.  After this phase, we define an unique and most successful package together with Client and use this for employer branding campaign and job advertisement. We deploy specialists if required in order to define the message and communication platforms with you. We also define the best suitable mix of recruitment channels in this specific area of the Client site (online and offline). In co-creation with Client we make a SWOT-analysis, in which the key points relating to; ""Why candidates like to work at Client"" have been processed. We compare the SWOT analysis with a (local) competition analysis, after which we determine together what strengths we use in the labour market communication and which channels are suitable. In doing so, we always keep the costs vs. the expected result in the back of our mind.  From our perspective, employer branding can only be realized if the internal organization supports this image and if there is commitment at all levels; before and during the execution."
469,"If Client is not satisfied with one of your temporary employees, what is your policy on replacement?","When a temporary worker, Gi Group, decides to end the assignment, an exit interview will always take place. The results of each exit interview is discussed with the responsible team leader of Client and included in the quarterly evaluation. Extraordinary outcomes are shared with HR.  If Client decides to end the assignment of a temporary worker; Client will specify the reason for this decision to Gi Group. Client must also comply with the statutory termination term ‘aanzegtermijnen’ of the assignment laid down in the Collective Labour Agreement of the ABU.  In order to avoid early exits (due to illness, if not complying or by leaving on own initiative), we manage our retention policy by organizing evaluations to follow-up on temporary workers and to undertake necessary actions if required. When a contract of a temporary worker terminates, your single point of contact (or onsite consultant) selects a suitable replacement from the outflowing workers, pools or new candidates within short notice.   In case Client is still not satisfied of one of our employees, a KPI will be defined to ensure replacement within timeframes defined in our SLA. Gi Group makes sure there is a pool in order to enable us to substitute the former temporary worker."
470,How will Gi Group optimize the planning?,"In the area of planning, we see many opportunities in terms of optimisations / cost savings; think of digitization, deployment planning tool, capacity management and uniformity. We recommend, however, to keep the planning process as it is now, and to tackle this project together at a later stage. The impact of the supplier changes, implementation and possible migration already has enough impact on Client , so all focus should be here now. Gi Group works a lot with KPIs within Service Level Agreements, so we propose to determine the KPI types, KPI definitions and KPI levels together with Client . Uniformity and measurability are leading in this."
471,Is an onsite occupation neccesary in your opinion?,"We recommend linking the on-site occupation per plant to two elements: 1. Hours per week (fluctuating based on peak demand); 2. Wishes of the Client  Plant in the field of on-site activities. There are Plants, which currently purchase an almost complete on-site service package, and Plants, where it is sufficient to only have telephone contact about the planning and to evaluate once a month or quarter. In our opinion, the on-site occupation is tailor-made for each plant, which we would like to discuss with the various Plants of Client .  Our onsite team, specialists in serving temporary clients in production and logistics, is supported by our central departments, enabling us to work efficiently and to scale up and down if necessary: • Central Recuitment Team: sourcing, screening, selection, reference checks, scheduling interviews with on-site team, etc .; • Central Administration Team: payroll, questions 1st line flex workers, sick leave, vacation registration, contracting, working hours, invoicing, audits, etc .; • Central Planning Team: plans services / transport / accommodation (together with on-site team), n.o.k.d. management, pool management, etc. The on-site team focuses entirely on the flex workers and on the stakeholders on the side of Client . In the case of EU flex workers, in addition to the on-site team and the central departments, we deploy Caretakers, who live with the EU flex workers and make every effort to ensure good living and working conditions for our workers and the quality of the candidates. They are our eyes and ears in the field."
472,How will Gi Group keep track of the attendance of the flex workers?,"We propose to implement Nedap's PEP Flex clock system across all Plants, uniformly for all suppliers. This is the most widely used software package in the temporary employment industry. Flex workers clock in and out with their personal PEP only with a PEP Reader.  PEP registers the clocked hours of the flex workers. The hours are approved by those responsible and then go to the salary package in Mysolution and Gi Group that can process the hours for invoicing.  The PEP system also keeps track of the hours worked with corresponding hour types, such as normal hours, allowance hours, overtime hours, etc. This is clear to those involved in real-time.  Clocking in on the PEP Readers is possible upon arrival, but can also be done by cost center, line or activity, for example. The readers are equipped with a battery and make contact with one PEP gateway that collects all information and sends it to the PEP software. The collection and forwarding is done via the GPRS network by means of a SIM card built into the gateway. This will give you a wealth of information about how much and for how long work has been carried out to cost center / activity level.  In addition, the manager has the option to view all hours worked in the current and previous weeks of the employee. The hours and rights accrued are also transparent. Both the accrued hours / entitlements and hours worked and allowances are transparent to the employee. It is possible for the manager to make a total overview of the hours worked and to export this. PEP Flex is already linked to Mysolution, so that we can digitally input the hours via an interface. This reduces the error margins and allows us to see in real-time who is clocked in, which makes attendance checks a lot easier. Running reports is also child's play. The costs for the implementation and use of PEP Flex are not yet included in our pricing, but are € 0.07 per booked hour, so this is manageable."
473,Could you give a short description of your organization?,"We are a temporary employment agency with national coverage. In the field of temporary employment, we mainly focus on the wholesale market in the sectors Logistics, Production and Customer Care. We supply cross border employees with the sub-brand Move Up. We are part of a global HR service provider that also carries the Grafton (professional organization) and Fashion & Luxury brands in the Netherlands."
474,Name three things that you do differently than other companies?,"1. We believe people are important. Contact with your flex workers and our customers is done by (onsite) consultants who are free from recruitment, marketing and administrative tasks. This allows them to fully focus on what is really important, namely the attention for flex workers and the unburdening of operations and the HR partnership with Client . 2. We have a healthy mix of personnel from the Netherlands and from other EU countries so that we can always continue to deliver. Because we have both recruitment sources in-house, we can continuously switch and, together with our customers, consider the best solution. Given that we recruit from 8 countries in Europe, it is also not the case that our customers get a dominant second culture in the workplace. 3. We provide real-time data about our entire services and are the frontrunner in the field of IT and digitization. Whether it concerns management reports, schedules, KPI reports or market analyzes, we offer this information via web portals to our candidates, customers, suppliers and sub-suppliers. In these web portals, we have built clear dashboards that can be adapted to specific customer requirements. As a result, we offer our customers the opportunity to create uniformity and insight into the data across the various Plants / departments, so that together we can make timely real-time adjustments and decisions can be made based on facts."
475,What IT landscape do you use to provide you services and gather and analyse data? Do you have dashboards for the Client and candidates?,"Gi Group uses Mysolution, the best all-in-one HR solution for agencies available on the Dutch market, where front-, mid- and back office data are integrated in one system on the Salesforce platform. All our functionalities are integrated in the same environment, so we support a full life-cycle of the data and connect all the dots. Instead of only using the standard Mysolution functionalities, we added a big number of supporting applications like; Salesforce Einstein, OnRecruit, Company.info, Jobdigger, Intelligence Group, Avnio, InGoedeBanen, etc. Another valuable application of Mysolution, is that we can build a custom made portal for Client, where we can share all relevant real-time data in the Salesforce environment like a real-time planning overview, management reports, KPI dashboards and vacancy tracking, but also more basic data like; average hourly rate, average multiplier, the amount of hours per type per week per department, etc."
476,Could you mention one innovation on the recruitment side of your company?,"We have integrated the NIXZ recruitment robot in our process, to automate easy repetitive tasks. Once we have learned NIXZ what to do, the robot takes over basic tasks from our recruitment department. When we give the NIXZ robot a vacancy, it checks the Indeed database for suited candidates, checks of the candidates are already in our system, if yes; it checks if the candidates do not already have an assignment, if yes; it sends out an automatized message by WhatsApp/email if the candidate wants to work for your group, if no; it asks a recruiter to send a message from the Indeed platform. The advantage for Client, is that we are able to scale up over 35% more rapidly because the robot takes over repetitive tasks."
477,What planning tool / software could you provide to the Client?,"Gi Group Netherlands has its own planning software, that we can offer free of charge to Client. It offers a wide variety of functionalities. Besides people, we also plan our cars park and housing locations we use for our cross-border candidates. We can tag candidates based on competences, geography, availability, certificates, experience, positions, etc. The planning tool also supports the management of different layers of temps in de Client pool, like; fixed employees, fulltime temps, part-time temps, “on-call” temps.  All Client stakeholders that are involved in the planning process, will also get access to the plannin through an Client portal, as well as the temps though their own portal. Besides direct contact with the onsite team about the planning, the software also has a self-support functionality (highly automated) and features and an advances ticket system."
478,What other IT tools/applications do you make use of in relation to data?,"Everyone in our organization, has access to a selection of Business Intelligence tools and the Data Warehouse of Salesforce Einstein, within Mysolution, our full-cycle HR platform. We can also see data from external sources and internal sources. Some examples of data of external sources, that are imbedded in Mysolution are: • Intelligence Group / Jobdigger These tools provides a target group dashboard, where we can find all data from several sources and provides us with supply analysis, labor market analysis and target group analysis on a very detailed level. We can even see employment conditions of Client’s competitors in the same region, looking for the same profiles, but also push and pull factors, connected to these profiles. The possibilities are limitless. With these BI tools, we can rapidly see changes in labor market, competition and economic changes. • Company.info  By integration of business intelligence tool Company.info in Mysolution, our employees have direct access to Dutch company data that we transform into comprehensive, clear and reliable information, with news and predictive insights about companies and its directors. Company.info provides Gi Group with: • Sharp insights into customers and markets; • Leads with the highest probability of conversion; • News alerts about customers and prospects.  • Salesforce Einstein analytics (data warehouse)   Salesforce Einstein and it’s Datawarehouse, is the heart of our organization. Is brings together all data streams and the Artificial Intelligence functionality gives us the possibility to atomize processes and predict possible outcomes. Salesforce Einstein is an extension of our standard Salesforce configuration where we can link the data from Salesforce with data from our finance software Business central. This link enables us to create reports with data from both environments. For Client, we build a custom made portal on the Mysolution platform in the Salesforce environment, with dashboards to monitor KPIs, figures and other relevant information."
